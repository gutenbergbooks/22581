PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">One</span>
of the most encouraging signs of the growth of musical taste and
understanding at the present time as regards the singing of children, is
the almost unanimous acquiescence of choirmasters, supervisors,
teachers, and others in the idea that children should sing softly, and
avoid loud and harsh tones; and the author ventures to hope that the
first edition of this book has helped, in a measure at least, to bring
about this state of opinion.</p>

<p>It is true that for a long time the art of training children’s voices
has been well understood by choirmasters of vested choirs, and by many
others, but its basis was purely empirical.</p>

<p>Something more, however, than the dictum of individual taste and
judgment is needed to convince the educators of our schools of the
wisdom
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
of any departure from established customs and practices. The primary
end, then, of the author has been to show a scientific basis for the use
of what is herein called the head-voice of the child, and to adduce,
from a study of the anatomy and physiology of the larynx and vocal
organs, safe principles for the guidance of those who teach children to
sing.</p>

<p>The conditions under which music is taught in schools call for an
appeal to the understanding first, and taste afterward. These conditions
are:</p>

<p>First, the actual teaching of music is done by class-room or grade
teachers. The special teacher, who usually supervises also, visits each
room, it may be as often as once a week, but in most towns and cities
not oftener than once in three or four weeks. At any rate the class form
their ideals and habits from the daily lessons, which are given by their
grade teacher.</p>

<p>Second, these teachers in the great majority of cases acquire their
knowledge of music through teaching it, and must also, it can easily be
understood, develop a sense of discrimination in musical matters in the
same way. There is a strong
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
natural tendency in the school-rooms to emphasize the <i>teaching</i> of
music, or teaching about music, as contrasted with actual singing. The
importance of using the voice properly will not suggest itself to many
teachers.</p>

<p>It is necessary, then, that this, which is the essence of all
instruction in vocal music, should be brought to the attention of the
vast army of instructors in our public schools in as convincing a way as
is possible. Now the best, and in fact the only way to secure the assent
of our educators to a new idea in school work, is to prove its truth.
“It is useless to dispute about tastes,” and so the less said about
harsh tone to a teacher accustomed to hear it daily, and to like it, the
better; but prove to this teacher that the harsh tone is physically
hurtful to the child, and that for physiological reasons the voice
should be used softly and gently, and you have won a convert, one, too,
who will quickly recognize the æsthetic phase of the change in voice
use. The author knows from observation and experience that children in
the public schools can, under existing conditions, be taught good habits
of voice use.
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
There are wonderful possibilities of musical development, in the study
of music in schools, and the active interest of every musician and music
lover should be exercised to the end that its standard may be kept
high.</p>

PREFACE.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">It</span>
will be generally admitted by those who are able to judge, that the
singing of children is more often disagreeable than pleasant, and yet
the charm of childhood and the effect of custom are so potent that many
who are keenly alive to any deficiency in the adult singer, listen with
tolerance, and it would seem with a degree of pleasure even, to the
harsh tones of children.</p>

<p>This tolerance of rough, strident singing by children is as strange
as the singing. It cannot be right for children to sing with the coarse,
harsh tone that is so common, and it is not right, although there is a
prevalent idea that such singing is natural, that is, unavoidable.</p>

<p>This idea is false. The child singing-voice is not rough and harsh
unless it is misused. The truth of this statement can be easily
demonstrated. If it were not true it would be difficult to justify the
teaching of vocal music <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘is’">in</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
schools, or the employment of boy sopranos in church choirs.</p>

<p>It seems to the author that the chief difficulty experienced by
teachers and instructors of singing, in dealing with children, lies in
the assumption, expressed or implied, that their voices are to be
treated as we treat the voices of adults&mdash;adult women; but the
vocal organs of the child differ widely from those of the adult in
structure, strength and general character. As a consequence, there is a
marked difference in voice.</p>

<p>Vocal music has been very generally introduced into the schools of
our country during the past few years, and there is evidently a very
general and earnest desire that children be taught to sing. It is also
the wish of those who are teachers to do their work well.</p>

<p>While there are many books to aid educators upon every other subject
taught in public schools, the literature on the voice, particularly the
singing-voice, is meagre, and it is believed that some direct, practical
hints on this topic may be welcome.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<p>The following pages are the result of several years’ experience in
teaching, and of careful study of children’s voices. The author has
attempted to describe the physiological characteristics of the
child-voice and to give some practical hints regarding its management.
It is sincerely hoped that what is herein written may be useful and
helpful to those engaged in teaching children to sing.</p>

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE VOICE.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">In</span>
former times the culture of the singing-voice was conducted upon purely
empirical grounds. Teachers followed a few good rules which had been
logically evolved from the experience of many schools of singing.</p>

<p>We are indebted to modern science, aided by the laryngoscope, for
many facts concerning the action of the larynx, and more especially the
vocal cords in tone-production. While the early discoveries regarding
the mechanism of the voice were hopefully believed to have solved all
problems concerning its cultivation, experience has shown the futility
of attempting to formulate a set of rules for voice-culture based alone
upon the incomplete data furnished by the laryngoscope. This instrument
is a small, round mirror which is introduced into the throat at such an
angle, that if horizontal rays of light are thrown upon it, the larynx,
which lies directly beneath, is illuminated and reflected in the mirror
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
at the back of the mouth&mdash;the laryngoscope. Very many singers and
teachers, of whom Manuel Garcia was the first, have made use of this
instrument to observe the action of their vocal bands in the act of
singing, and the results of these observations are of the greatest
value. Still, as before said, the laryngoscope does not reveal all the
secrets of voice-production. While it tells unerringly of any departure
from the normal, or of pathological change in the larynx, it does not
tell whether the larynx belongs to the greatest living singer or to one
absolutely unendowed with the power of song. Also, the subject of vocal
registers is as vexing to-day as ever.</p>

<p>While, then, we may confidently expect further and more complete
elucidation of the physiology of the voice, there is yet sufficient data
to guide us safely in vocal training, if we neglect not the empirical
rules which the accumulated experience of the past has established.</p>

<p>The organ by which the singing-voice is produced is the larynx. It
forms the upper extremity of the windpipe, which again is the upper
portion and beginning of the bronchial
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
tubes, which, extending downward, branch off from its lower part to
either side of the chest and continually subdivide until they become
like little twigs, around which cluster the constituent parts of the
lungs, which form the bellows for the supply of air necessary to the
performance of vocal functions. Above, the larynx opens into the throat
and the cavities of the pharynx, mouth, nose, and its accessory
cavities, which constitute the resonator for vocal vibrations set up
within the larynx.</p>

<p>The larynx itself consists of a framework of cartilages joined by
elastic membranes or ligaments, and joints. These cartilages move freely
toward and upon each other by means of attached muscles. Also the larynx
as a whole can be moved in various directions by means of extrinsic
muscles joined to points above and below.</p>

<p>The vocal bands are two ligaments or folds of mucous membrane
attached in front to the largest cartilage of the larynx, called the
thyroid, and which forms in man the protuberance commonly called Adam’s
apple; and, extending
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
horizontally backward, are inserted posteriorly into the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘aryteniod’">arytenoid</ins>
cartilages, the right vocal band into the right arytenoid cartilage and
the left band into the left cartilage. These arytenoid cartilages, by
means of an articulation or joint, move freely upon the cricoid, the
second large cartilage of the larynx, forming its base, and sometimes
called the ring cartilage, from its resemblance in shape to a seal ring.
The vocal bands are composed of numberless elastic fibres running in
part parallel to each other, and in part interwoven in various
directions with each other. The fibres also vary in length; some are
inserted into the extending projections, called processes of the
arytenoid cartilages, and some extend further back and are inserted into
the body of the cartilages. The vocal bands, then, lie opposite each
other, on a level, raised a little in front, and with a narrow slit
between, called the glottis.</p>

<p>The muscles controlling the action of the vocal bands, and which
regulate the mechanism producing sound, are of three groups, viz.,
abductors (drawing-apart muscles), adductors (drawing-together muscles),
and tensors.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<p>The abductors act to keep the bands apart during respiration, while
the function of the adductors and tensors is to bring the bands into
position for speech or singing. They are, since phonation is at will,
voluntary muscles; but it is an interesting fact that the laryngeal
muscles of either side invariably act together. It has been shown that
it is not possible to move one vocal cord without the other at the same
time executing the same movement. It is thus shown that the laryngeal
muscles are, to a less extent, under the control of the will than are
those of either hand or eye. The rational training of the singing-voice
cannot, therefore, proceed upon any theory based upon the voluntary
training of the muscles controlling the movements of the vocal
cords.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane which lines the larynx is liberally supplied with
secreting glands, whose function is to keep the parts moist. Above the
vocal bands, another pair of membranous ligaments are stretched across
the larynx forming, with its sides and the vocal bands, a&nbsp;pouch or
pocket. The upper ligaments are sometimes
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
called the false vocal cords, but are more properly termed ventricular
bands. Their function has occasioned much speculation, but whatever
modification of tone they may be supposed to produce, they no doubt
protect the true vocal bands and permit their free vibration. The
larynx, in the production of sound, may be compared to an organ-pipe.
The two vocal cords which act simultaneously and are anatomically alike,
when set in vibration by the blast of air coming from the lungs,
correspond to the reed of the organ-pipe; the vibration of the cords,
producing sound, which is communicated to the air enclosed in the
cavities of the chest and head. Pitch of tone is determined by the
rapidity of vibrations of the bands, according to acoustical law, and
the length, size, and tension of the cords will determine the number of
vibrations per second, <i>i.e.</i>, their rapidity.</p>

<p>Strength or loudness of tone is determined primarily by the width or
amplitude of the vibrations of the vocal membrane, and quality or timbre
is determined by the form of the vibration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p>The infinitely varying anatomical divergencies in the form and
structure of the nasal, pharyngeal and throat cavities, and possibly the
composition of the vocal bands, modifies, in numberless ways, the
character of tone in speech or song. It is a fascinating topic, but must
be dismissed here with the remark that, as those anatomical differences
in structure are far less marked in children than in adults, their
voices are, in consequence, more alike in quality and strength. It takes
long, patient training to blend adult voices, but children’s voices,
when properly used, are homogeneous in tone.</p>

<p>The voices of boys and girls, prior to the age of puberty, are alike.
The growth of the larynx, which in each is quite rapid up to the age of
six years, then, according to all authorities with which the writer is
conversant, ceases, and the vocal bands neither lengthen nor thicken, to
any appreciable extent, before the time of change of voice, which occurs
at the age of puberty.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible, however, that the larynx literally remains
<i>unchanged</i> through the
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
period of the child’s life, extending from the age of six to fourteen or
fifteen years. In point of fact, authorities upon the subject refer only
to the lack of growth and development in <i>size</i> of the larynx
during the period; but <i>undoubtedly, during these years, there is a
constant gaining of firmness and strength, in both the cartilages and
their connecting membranes and muscles</i>. None of the books written
upon the voice have even mentioned this most important fact. It bears
with great significance upon questions relating to the capacities of the
child’s voice at different ages, and explains that phenomenon called the
“movable break,” which has puzzled so many in their investigations of
the registers of the child’s voice. The constant, though of course
extremely slow, hardening of the cartilaginous portions of the larynx,
and the steady increase in the strength of its muscles and ligaments is
not in the least inconsistent with the previously noted fact, that the
vocal bands during this time increase to no appreciable extent in
length; for, it may be observed, after the
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
change of voice, which often occurs with great rapidity, and during
which the vocal bands increase to double their previous length in males,
that, though the pitch of the voice, owing to increased length of the
bands, suddenly lowers, yet not until full maturity is reached, do the
laryngeal cartilages attain that rigidity, or the vocal bands that ready
elasticity essential to the production of pure, resonant voice. Yet,
during these years, while the voice is developing, the vocal bands
remain unchanged in <i>length</i>. Even in those cases where the voice
changes slowly in consequence of the slow growth in length and thickness
of the vocal cords, it takes several years, after laryngeal development
has ceased, for the voice to attain its full size and resonance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the continual increase in strength and firmness of the
larynx from six years onward to puberty, is consistent with the constant
growth in strength and firmness of tissue characterizing the entire
body. It is again proven by the continual improvement in the power and
timbre of the tone through this period,
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
always premising, be it understood, that the voice is used properly, and
never forced beyond its natural capabilities. The voice, at the age of
eleven or twelve, is far stronger, and is capable of more sustained
effort than at the age of six or seven years, and, for the year or two
preceding the break of voice, the brilliance and power of boys’ voices,
especially in the higher tones, is often phenomenal, and in all cases is
far superior to that of previous years.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the voices of boys and girls, a resemblance
which amounts to identity, save that the voices of boys are stronger and
more brilliant in quality, disappears at puberty.</p>

<p>Among the physical changes which occur at this period is a marked
growth of the larynx, sufficient to alter entirely the pitch and
character of the boy’s voice. As a female larynx is affected to a lesser
extent, the voices of girls undergo little change in pitch, but become
eventually more powerful, and richer in tone.</p>

<p>This break of the voice, as it is called, occurs at about the age of
fifteen years in this climate,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
but often a year or two earlier, and not infrequently a year or two
later. The growth of the larynx goes on, with greater or less rapidity,
varying in different individuals, for from six months to two or three
years, until it attains its final size. In boys, the larynx doubles in
size, and the vocal bands increase in the proportion of five to ten in
length. This great gain in the length of the vocal cords is due to the
lateral development of the larynx, for the male larynx, in its entirety,
increases more in depth than in height. The result is a drop of an
octave in the average boy’s voice, the longer bands producing lower
tones. The change in size in the female larynx is in the proportion of
five to seven, and the increase is in height instead of depth or width
as in the male larynx. The vocal cords of women are, therefore, shorter,
thinner and narrower than are those of men.</p>

<p>The reason assigned for the peculiar antics of the boy’s voice,
during the break, is unequal rapidity in the growth and development of
the cartilages and of the muscles of the larynx. The
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
muscles develop more slowly than do the cartilages, and so abnormal
physical conditions produce abnormal results in phonation.</p>

<p>No further changes occur in the laryngeal structure until middle
life, when ossification of the cartilages commences. The thyroid is
first affected, then the cricoid, and the arytenoids much later.</p>

<p>The consequent rigidity of the larynx occasions diminished compass of
the singing-voice, the notes of the upper register being the first to
disappear. In some few cases of arrested development, the voice of the
man retains the soprano compass of the boy through life.</p>

REGISTERS OF THE VOICE.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">It</span>
may be observed, in listening to an ascending series of tones sung by an
untrained or by a badly-trained adult voice, that at certain pitches the
tone-quality undergoes a radical change; while a well-trained singer
will sing the same series of tones without showing any appreciable break
or change in tone-quality, although the highest note will present a
marked contrast in timbre to the lowest. The breaks or changes in
register so noticeable in the untrained voice are covered or equalized
in the voice trained by correct methods. These breaks in both male and
female voices occur at certain pitches where the tone-producing
mechanism of the larynx changes action, and brings the vocal bands into
a new vibratory form. “A register consists of a series of tones produced
by the same mechanism.”&mdash;Emil Behnke in “Voice, Song, and Speech.”
G.&nbsp;Edward Stubbs, in commenting upon the above definition,
says:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<p>“By mechanism is meant the action of the larynx which produces
<i>different sets of vibrations</i>, and by register is meant the range
of voice confined to a given set of vibrations. In passing the voice
from one register to another, the larynx changes its mechanism and calls
into play a different form of vibration.”</p>

<p>The number of vocal registers, or vibratory forms, which the vocal
bands assume, is still a matter of dispute, and their nomenclature is
equally unsettled. The old Italian singing-masters gave names to parts
of the vocal compass corresponding to the real or imaginary bodily
sensations experienced in singing them; as chest-voice, throat-voice,
head-voice. Madame Seiler, in “The Voice in Singing,” gives as the
result of original investigations with the laryngoscope five different
actions of the vocal bands which she classifies as “first and second
series of the chest-register,” “first and second series of the falsetto
register” and “head-register.” Browne and Behnke, in “Voice, Song, and
Speech,” divide the male voice into three registers, and the female into
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
five. They are termed “lower thick,” “upper thick,” “lower thin,” “upper
thin” and “small.” Other writers speak of three registers, “chest,”
“medium” and “head,” and still others of two only, viz., the chest and
the head.</p>

<p>Modern research has shown what was after all understood before, that,
if the vibratory form assumed by the vocal bands for the natural
production of a certain set of tones is pushed by muscular exertion
above the point where it should cease, inflammation and weakening of the
vocal organs will result, while voice-deterioration is sure to follow.
A&nbsp;physiological basis has reinforced the empirical deductions of
the old Italian school. In dealing with children’s voices, it is
necessary to recognize only two registers, the thick, or chest-register,
and the thin, or head-register. Further subdivisions will only
complicate the subject without assisting in the practical management of
their voices. Tones sung in the thick or chest-register are produced by
the full, free vibration of the vocal bands in their entire length,
breadth and thickness.
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
The tones of the thin or head-register result from the vibration of the
vocal bands along their inner edges alone.</p>

<p>We may then conclude from the foregoing that <i>children up to the
age of puberty, at least in class or chorus singing, should use the thin
or head-register only</i>.</p>

<p>1st. It is from a physiological standpoint entirely safe. The use of
this register will not strain or overwork the delicate vocal organs of
childhood.</p>

<p>2d. Its tones are musical, pure and sweet, and their use promotes the
growth of musical sensibility and an appreciation of beauty in tone.</p>

<p>3d. The use of the thick or chest-voice in class-singing is
dangerous. It is wellnigh impossible to confine it within proper
limits.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discuss the second point. Anyone who has noted
the contrast between the harsh quality of tone emitted from childish
throats when using the chest-voice, and the pure, flute-like sound
produced when the head-tones are sung will agree that the last is music
and the first noise, or at any rate very noisy, barbaric music.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<p>The third point, if true, establishes the first, for, if the
chest-voice cannot be safely used, it follows that children must use the
head-register or stop singing. It must be said, before proceeding
further, that it is not denied that the thick voice can be used by
children without injury, if properly managed; that is, if the singing be
not too loud, and if it be not carried too high. It is also fully
recognized, that, when theoretically the head-voice alone is used, it
yet, when carried to the lower tones, insensibly blends into the thick
register; but if this equalization of registers is obtained so
completely that no perceptible difference in quality of voice can be
observed, why then the whole compass is practically the thin or
head-register.</p>

<p>Now, can the thick voice be used in school-singing, and confined to
the lower notes? And is it fairly easy to secure soft and pure
vocalizations in this register? Let the experience of thousands of
teachers in the public schools of this and other lands answer the last
question.</p>

<p>It would be as easy to stop the growth of the average boy with a
word, or to persuade a crowd
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
of youngsters to speak softly at a game of baseball, as to induce them,
or girls either for that matter, to use the voice gently, when singing
with that register in which it is possible to push the tone and
shout.</p>

<p>There should be some good physiological reason for the habitual
recourse to the strident chest-voice so common with boys, and nearly as
usual with girls. And there is a good reason. It is <i>lack of rigidity
in the voice-box or larynx</i>. Its cartilages harden slowly, and even
just before the age of puberty the larynx falls far short of the
firmness and rigidity of structure, that characterize the organ in adult
life. It is physically very difficult for the adult to force the
chest-voice beyond its natural limits, which become fixed when full
maturity of bodily development is reached, but the child, whose
laryngeal cartilages are far more flexible, and move toward and upon
each other with greater freedom, can force the chest-voice up with great
ease. The altitude of pitch which is attained before breaking into the
thin register is with young children regulated by the
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
amount of muscular exertion they put forth<ins class = "correction"
title = "text has comma">. </ins>Even up to the change of voice, boys
can often force the thick register several notes higher than women
sopranos.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the thick voice is produced by the
full, free vibrations of the vocal bands in their entire length, breadth
and thickness.</p>

<p>Imagine children six years of age carrying tones formed in this
manner to the extreme limit of their voice; yet they do it. The tone of
infant classes in Sunday-schools, and the tone of the primary schools,
as they sing their morning hymns or songs for recreation, is produced in
nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand in exactly the way
set forth. If the vocal bands of children were less elastic, if they
were composed of stronger fibres, and protected from undue exertion by
firm connecting cartilage; in short, if children were not children, such
forcing would not be possible. If it were not for the wonderful
recuperative power of childhood, serious effects would follow such vocal
habits.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<p>We are now prepared to understand that common phenomenon of the
child-voice, termed the “movable break.” Every public school teacher who
has had experience in teaching singing must be familiar with the meaning
of the term, though possibly unaware of it. Allusion has already been
made to the fact that, in primary grades, the thick quality, if
permitted, will be carried as high as the children sing, to</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music32a.png" width = "77" height = "51"
alt = "high E"></p>

<p>for example. If they are required to sing <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> higher tones lightly, then the
three or four tones, just below the pitch indicated, will be sung in a
thin quality of voice. The place of the break or the absence of any
break at all will depend upon the degree of loudness permitted.</p>

<p>Pass now to a grade in which the pupils average eleven years of age.
These can use the thick tones as high as</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music32b.png" width = "102" height = "51"
alt = "high D, high E"></p>

<p>only with great exertion, and, if required to sing softly, will pass
into the thin register at a lower
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
pitch than the primary class. Now, go to a room where the children range
in age from thirteen to fifteen years. The girls will still use thick
tones up to</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music33a.png" width = "133" height = "51"
alt = "B, C, D"></p>

<p>The pitch at which the break occurs will vary in individual cases
according to physique or ambition to sing well; but the boys (excluding
those whose voices have begun to break) will manifest the utmost
repugnance to singing the higher notes. “Can’t sing high” will be the
reply when you ask them why they do not sing. And they are correct. They
cannot, not with the thick voice. Even when putting forth considerable
exertion, they will pass to the thin voice at</p>

<p class = "music">
or<br>
<img src = "images/music33b.png" width = "102" height = "51"
alt = "G or A"></p>

<p>and lower, if they sing softly. This phenomenon, then, is the
“movable break” of the child-voice. The pitch at which the child-voice
passes from the thick to the thin voice depends first upon the age;
second, upon the amount of physical
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
energy employed, and third, upon the bodily vigor of the child.</p>

<p>It may also be added that boys’ voices break lower than girls’ during
the year or two preceding change of voice. When, now, it is remembered
that the adult female voice leaves the chest-register at</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music34.png" width = "110" height = "51"
alt = "F, F sharp"></p>

<p>it will be admitted by everyone who has had actual experience in
class singing in schools or elsewhere, that the facts set forth in
reference to the ability of the child to carry the thick voice from one
to eight tones higher than the adult, has a very important bearing on
the subject of training children’s voices.</p>

<p>But, is it physically injurious? It may be said that, as regards
upward forcing of the vocal register, authorities upon the adult voice
are united. Leo Kofler, in “The Art of Breathing,” p. 168, says: “I have
met female trebles that used this means of forcing up the chest-tones as
high as middle&nbsp;A, B,&nbsp;C, and (one can hardly conceive of the
physical possibility of so
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
doing) even as far as D and E flat. The reason why this practice is so
dangerous lies in the unnatural way in which the larynx is held down in
the throat, and in the force that is exercised by the tension muscles of
the vocal ligaments and the hard pressure of the muscles of the
tongue-bone.... I&nbsp;have examined with the laryngoscope many ladies
who had the habit of singing the chest-tones too high, and, without
exception, I&nbsp;have found their throats in a more or less diseased
condition. Laryngitis, either alone or complicated with pharyngitis,
relaxation of the vocal ligaments, and sometimes paralysis of one of
them, are the most frequent results of this bad habit. If a singer is
afflicted with catarrhal trouble, it is always aggravated by this
abominable method of singing.”</p>

<p>Emma Seiler, in “The Voice in Singing,” p. 54, after describing the
action of the vocal ligaments in the production of the chest-voice and
alluding to the fact that such action can be continued several tones
higher than the proper transitional point, goes on: “But such tones,
especially in the female voice, have that rough
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
and common timbre, which we are too often compelled to hear in our
female singers. The glottis also in this case, as well as parts of the
larynx near the glottis, betrays the effort very plainly; as the tones
ascend, they grow more and more red. <i>Thus, as at this place in the
chest-register, there occurs a visible and sensible straining of the
organs, so also is it in all the remaining transitions, as soon as the
attempt is made to extend the action by which the lower tones are formed
beyond the given limits of the same</i>.” And again: “In the ignorance
existing concerning the natural transitions of the registers, and in the
unnatural forcing of the voice, is found a chief cause of the decline in
the art of singing, and the present inability to preserve the voice is
the consequence of a method of teaching unnatural, and, therefore,
imposing too great a strain upon the voice.” Quotations innumerable
might be made, to give more emphasis, were it needed, to the evils of
register forcing.</p>

<p>The only point remaining is the one very often raised. Is it not
<i>natural for children</i> to use
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
the chest or thick voice? If their vocal organs are so flexible, may
they not carry such tones higher than adults, and younger children
higher than those a little older, and so&nbsp;on?</p>

<p>It is quite obvious, for reasons herein set forth, that children do
not experience the same degree of difficulty in continuing the use of
the thick voice to their higher tones as do adults, but as to the effect
upon their vocal organs there need be no reasonable doubt. A.&nbsp;B.
Bach, in “Principles of Singing,” p. 142, says: “If children are allowed
to sing their higher notes forte, before the voice is properly
equalized, it will become hard, harsh and hoarse, and they will fail in
correct intonation. A&nbsp;mistake in this direction not only ruins the
middle register but destroys the voice altogether. The consequence of
encouraging forte singing is to change a soprano rapidly to an alto; and
they will generally sing alto equally forte because their vocal cords
have lost their elasticity through overstraining and the notes will no
longer answer to piano.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The fact is that
reckless singing often breaks tender voices and
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
breaks them forever.” It may be observed that the writer cited evidently
accepts the same classification in register for children and adult
women’s voices, but this does not make the above extract any less
applicable. The baneful effects of forcing the voice is clearly set
forth. How to avoid it is another matter.</p>

<p>Leo Kofler, in the work previously mentioned, p. 168, refers to this
point as follows: “It frequently happens that the tones of the lower
range, or the so-called chest-tones, are forced up too high into the
middle range. This bad habit is often contracted while the singers are
quite young. Boy trebles have this habit to an unendurable degree,
usually screaming those horrible chest-tones up to middle&nbsp;C. Of all
bad habits, this one is the most liable to injure a voice and to detract
from artistic singing.”</p>

<p>To cite Madame Seiler once more, p. 176: “While it often happens that
at the most critical age while the vocal organs are being developed,
children sing with all the strength they can command. Boys, however, in
whom the larynx at a certain period undergoes an entire
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
transformation, reach only with difficulty the higher soprano or
contralto tones, but are not assigned a lower part until perceiving
themselves the impossibility of singing in this way, they beg the
teacher for the change, often too late, unhappily, to prevent an
irreparable injury. Moderate singing without exertion, and above all
things, within the natural limits of the voice and its registers, would
even during the period of growth be as little hurtful as speaking,
laughing or any other exercise which cannot be forbidden to the vocal
organs.”</p>

<p>Browne and Behnke, who separately and together have given most
valuable additions to the literature of the voice, in a small book
entitled “The Child-Voice,” have collated a large number of answers from
distinguished singers, teachers and choir-trainers to various questions
relating to the subject. The following citation is from this interesting
work, p.&nbsp;39: “The necessity of limiting the compass of children’s
voices is frequently insisted upon, no attention whatever being paid to
<i>registers</i>; and yet in finitely more mischief is done by forcing
the
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
registers than would be accomplished by allowing children to exceed the
compass generally assigned to them, always provided that the singing be
the result of using the mechanism set apart by nature for different
parts of the voice.”</p>

<p>There can really be no doubt that the use of the chest or thick voice
upon the higher tones is injurious to a child of six years, or ten
years, or of any other age. The theory that in the child-voice the
breaks occur at higher fixed pitches than in the adult is shown to be
untenable. The fact would seem to be that comparisons between the
registers of the child and the adult voice are misleading, since the
adult voice has fixed points of change in the vocal mechanism, which can
be transcended only with great difficulty, while the child-voice has
<i>no fixed points of change in its vocal registers</i>. This point must
not be overlooked. It is the most important fact connected with the
child-voice in speech or song. It is the fundamental idea of this work
and is the basis for whatever suggestions are herein contained upon the
management of the child-voice. The rigidity
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
of the adult larynx, the strength of the tensor and adductor muscles and
the elastic firmness of the vocal ligaments, are to those of the child
as the solid bony framework and strongly set muscles of maturity are to
the imperfectly hardened bones and soft muscles of childhood. Nature
makes no fixed limits of the vocal registers until full maturity is
reached. A&nbsp;fixed register in a childish throat involving a
completely developed larynx would be a startling anomaly. The laryngeal
muscles of childhood are not strong. They are weak. Most of the talk
about strength of voice in children is utter nonsense. When the muscles
and other parts concerned in tone-production perform their physiological
functions in a healthy manner, that is, in such a way that no
congestion, or inflammation or undue weariness will result, the
singing-tone of the child will never be loud. High or low, under these
conditions it must perforce be soft, and if proper directions be
followed the quality will be as good as the voice is
capable&nbsp;of.</p>

<p>Everyone who has observed has also noticed
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
the contrast in the lower tones of children and women. The chest-voice
of the woman, which she uses in singing her lower register, is normally
very beautiful in its quality. Its tones are the product of a perfectly
developed, full-grown organ. The chest-voice of the child is an abnormal
product of a weak, growing, undeveloped organ. It possesses, even when
used carefully, little of the tone tints of the adult voice. The
chest-voice belongs to adult life, not to childhood. The so-called
chest-voice of children is only embryonic. It cannot be musical, for the
larynx has not reached that stage of growth and development where it can
produce these tones musically. The constant use of this hybrid register
with children is injurious in many ways. Its use is justified in schools
merely through custom, and it can not be doubted that as soon as the
attention of teachers is called to its evils, they will no longer
tolerate its use.</p>

<p>The usual analogies then which are drawn between the adult female
voice and the child-voice, in so far as they imply a similar
physiological condition
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
of the vocal organ and similar vocal training, are not only useless, but
misleading. He who tries to train the average child-voice on the theory
of two, three or five clearly-defined breaks, or natural changes in the
forms for vocal vibration assumed by the vocal bands will get very
little help from nature.</p>

<p>With due consideration it is said that it is a harder task to train
children’s voices properly than to train the voices of adults. Where
nature is so shifty in her ways, it requires keen penetration to
discover her ends.</p>

<p>The child-voice is a delicate instrument. It ought not to be played
upon by every blacksmith.</p>

HOW TO SECURE GOOD TONE.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
practical application of the teaching of the two preceding chapters may
at first thought seem to be difficult. On the contrary, it is quite
easy. We have favorable conditions in schools; graded courses in music,
regular attendance, discipline, and women and men in charge who are
accustomed to teach. No more favorable conditions for teaching vocal
music exist than are to be found in a well-organized and
well-disciplined school. The environments of both pupils and teachers
are exactly adapted
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
to the ready reception of ideas, on the one hand, and the skilful
imparting of them, on the other.</p>

<p>The abilities of the trained teachers of to-day are not half
appreciated. They often possess professional skill of the highest order,
and the supervisor of music in the public schools may count himself
exceedingly fortunate in the means he has at hand for carrying on his
work. But knowledge of voice is no more evolved from one’s inner
consciousness than is knowledge of musical notation, or of the Greek
alphabet; therefore, if regular teachers in the school permit singing
which is unmusical and hurtful, it is chiefly because they are following
the usual customs, and their ears have thereby become dulled, or it may
be that even if the singing is unpleasant to them, that they do not
<i>know how</i> to make it better. As before said, all energies have so
far been directed to the teaching of music reading. Tone has been
neglected, forgotten, or at most its improvement has been sought
spasmodically. The carelessness regarding tone, which is so prevalent,
is due to an almost entire absence of good teaching on the subject of
the child-voice&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
to ignorance, let us say&mdash;not altogether inexcusable.</p>

<p>Now and then, when listening to the soprani of some well-trained
boy-choir, sounding soft and mellow on the lower notes and ringing clear
and flutey on the higher, it may have dimly occurred to the teacher of
public school music that there might be things as yet unheard of in his
musical philosophy, a&nbsp;vague wonder and dissatisfaction, which has
slowly disappeared under the pressure of routine work.</p>

<p>When one reflects upon the results which the patience and skill of
our regular teachers have accomplished in teaching pupils to read music;
it can never be reasonably doubted that the same patience and skill, if
rightly directed, will be equally successful in teaching a correct use
of the voice.</p>

<p>Two principles form the basis of good tone-production as applied to
children’s voices.</p>

<p>1st. <i>They must sing softly.</i></p>

<p>2d. <i>They must be restricted in compass of voice.</i></p>

<p>If these two rules are correctly applied in
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
each grade, if pupils sing <i>softly enough</i>, and carry their tones
neither too high nor too low, always taking into account the grade or
average age of the class, then the voice will be used <i>only in the
thin or head-register</i>, and the tones of the thick or chest-register
will never be heard. But the two rules must be as one, for if soft
singing be carried too low with infant voices, they are forced to use
the thick tones; and children of all ages, even if singing within the
right compass of voice, will use the thick register if permitted to sing
too loud.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly original in insisting upon soft singing
from children. The writer has never seen a book of school music that
does not mention its desirability, nor hardly a reference to the
child-voice in the standard works or writings of the day of which this
idea has not formed a part.</p>

<p>The general direction “Sing softly” is good so far as it goes, but
is, first, indefinite. Softly and loudly are relative terms, and subject
to wide diversity of interpretation. The pianissimo of a cultivated
singer is silence compared
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
to the tone emitted by vocalists of the main strength order, when
required to produce soft tone. Secondly, the direction is seldom or
never found coupled with instruction upon the vocal compass of children.
Hence, it does not seem very strange that the injunction “Sing softly”
has not corrected vocal errors in school singing.</p>

<p>It is not easy, it is even impossible, to accurately define soft
singing, and no attempt will be made further than to describe as clearly
as may be the degree of softness which it is necessary to insist upon if
we would secure the use of the thin or head register.</p>

<p>The subject of register has already been discussed, but it may not be
amiss to repeat just here that in the child larynx as in the adult the
head-register is that series of tones which are produced by the
vibration of the thin, inner edges of the vocal band. If breathing is
natural, and if the throat is open and relaxed, no strain in singing
this tone is possible. It is evident in a moment that children with
their thin, delicate vocal ligaments can make this tone
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
even more easily than adult sopranos, whose vocal ligaments are longer
and thicker; and it is also perfectly evident that no danger of strain
to the vocal bands is incurred when this voice is used, for all the
muscles and ligaments of the larynx are under far less tension than is
required for the production of tones in the thick register.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered in connection with this fact, that
children often enter school at five years of age, and that according to
physiologists the larynx does not reach the full growth in <i>size</i>,
incidental to childhood until the age of six years. We must then be
particularly careful with infant classes&mdash;for the vocal bands of
children prior to six years of age are very, very weak. Speaking of
infant voices, Mr. W.&nbsp;M. Miller, in Browne and Behnke’s
afore-mentioned work, “The Child-Voice,” is quoted as saying;
“Voice-<i>training</i> cannot be attempted, but voice-<i>destruction</i>
may be prevented. Soft singing is the cure for all the ills of the vocal
organs.” It would be hard to find a more terse or truthful statement
than the first sentence of the above as
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
regards the voices of little children from five to seven or eight years
of age. It is unmitigated foolishness to talk about vocal training as
applied to children of that age. The voice-culture which is suited to
little children is that sort of culture which promotes growth&mdash;food
and sleep and play. As well train a six months’ old colt for the race
track, as attempt to develop the voice of a child of six or seven years
with exercises on <i>o</i>, and <i>ah</i>, <i>pianissimo</i> and
<i>fortissimo</i>, <i>crescendo</i>, <i>diminuendo</i> and <i>swell</i>.
Their voices must be used in singing as <i>lightly as possible</i>. This
answers the question, how softly should they sing?</p>

<p>Children during the first two or three years of school-life may be
permitted to sing from</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music50a.png" width = "110" height = "51"
alt = "E, high E"></p>

<p>or if the new pitch is used from</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music50b.png" width = "110" height = "51"
alt = "F, high F"></p>

<p>Two or three practical difficulties will at once occur to the teacher
with reference to songs and exercises which range lower than E first
line,
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
and with reference to the customary teaching of the scale of C as the
initial step in singing.</p>

<p>The subject of compass of children’s voices will be discussed at some
length in a following chapter, but for the present it may be said that
the difficulty with songs and exercises ranging below the pitch
indicated may be overcome easily by pitching the songs, etc.,
a&nbsp;tone or two higher. If they then range too high, don’t sing them,
sing something else. In teaching the scale, take E or F as the keynote,
and sing either one or the other of those scales first. The children
must sing as softly as possible in all their singing exercises, whether
songs or note drill. They should be taught to open their mouths well, to
sit or stand erect as the case may be, and under no circumstances should
the instructor sing with them. Too much importance can hardly be given
to this last statement. If teachers persist in leading the songs with
their own voices and in singing exercises with the children, they can
and most probably will defeat all efforts to secure the right tone in
either the first, or any grade up to that in which changed
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
voices are found. This sounds rather cynical, and might seem to imply
that instructors cannot sing well. The meaning, however, is quite
different.</p>

<p>The quality or timbre of the adult woman’s voice is wholly unlike
that of the child’s thin register. Her medium tones, even when sung
softly, have a fuller and more resonant quality, and if she lead in
songs, etc., the pupils, with the proverbial aptitude for imitation,
will inevitably endeavor to imitate her tone-quality. They can only do
so by using the thick register, which it is so desirable to utterly
avoid. It is worse yet for a man to lead the singing. Neither should one
of the pupils be allowed to lead, for not only will the one leading
force the voice in the effort, but a chance is offered to any ambitious
youngster to pitch in and outsing the leader; from all of which follows
naturally the idea that all prominence of individual voice must be
discouraged, forbidden even. The songs and exercises must be led, it is
true, but by the teacher and <i>silently</i>. Then, again, unless the
teacher is silent she cannot be
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
a good critic. Think of a voice-trainer singing each solfeggio and song
with his pupil during the lesson.</p>

<p>Certainly it is often necessary for the teacher to sing, but only to
illustrate or correct, or to teach a song. In the last, if the teacher
will remain silent while the class repeat the line sung to them, and
will proceed in the same way until the whole is memorized by the class,
not only will time be economized, but the tone can be kept as soft as is
desired and individual shouters checked. Once more it must be insisted
that soft, very soft singing only, can be allowed. And this applies to
the entire compass used. Children of the ages mentioned can, as has
already been shown, break from the thin to the thick voice at any pitch,
it only requiring a little extra push for the upper tones.</p>

<p>Finally, as an excellent test to settle if the tone is soft enough to
ensure the use of the thin register beyond doubt, require the class to
sing so that no particular voice can be distinguished from the others,
which will make the tone as that of one voice, and perhaps lead you to
doubt
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
if all are singing, until convinced by the movement of their mouths. The
tone will seem pretty light and thin, but will be sweet as the trill of
a bird.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
To Distinguish Registers.</h5>

<p>The difficulty which may be experienced in attempting to distinguish
between the two registers must not be disregarded. If the voices of
children were never entrusted to any save professional voice-teachers,
a&nbsp;very few hints upon their management would perhaps suffice, for
the ear of the teacher of voice and singing is presumably trained in the
differentiation in tone-quality occasioned by changes in the action of
the vocal mechanism. When, however, we reflect that of the thousands of
teachers in our public schools very few, indeed, have ever heard of
voice-registers, and much less been accustomed to note distinctions in
tone-timbre between them, the need of a detailed plan of procedure is
seen.</p>

<p>It is safe to assert that anyone with a musical ear can with a little
patience learn to distinguish
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
one register from another. There is no vocal transition so marked as the
change from thick to thin register in the child-voice, unless it be the
change from the chest to the head or falsetto in the man’s voice.
Suppose we take a class of say twelve from the fourth year averaging
nine years of age. Give them the pitch of&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Require them to sing up the scale loudly. As they reach the upper
tone</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music55b.png" width = "86" height = "51"
alt = "high C"></p>

<p>stop them and ask them to sing that, and the two tones above <i>very
softly</i>. The change in tone will be quite apparent. The tone used in
ascending the scale of C, singing loudly, will be reedy, thick and
harsh&mdash;the thick register. The tone upon</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music55c.png" width = "133" height = "51"
alt = "high C, D, E"></p>

<p>singing very softly, will be flute-like, thin and clear&mdash;the
thin register. Again, let them sing
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
E first line with full strength of voice and then the octave lightly, or
have them sing G second line, first softly and then loudly, or, again,
let them ascend the scale of E singing as light a tone as possible, and
then descend singing as loud as they can. In each case the change from
thick to thin voice, or vice versa, will be illustrated; and in singing
the scale of E as suggested, the break of voice a little higher or lower
in individual cases will be noticed. It is quite possible that some
members of the class may use the thick voice on each tone of the
descending scale beginning with the highest.</p>

<p>Care must always be taken that in singing softly the mouth be well
opened. The tendency will be to close it when required to sing lightly,
but the tone, then, will be nothing but a humming noise. It may as well
be said here that a great deal of future trouble and labor may be
avoided, if, from the first, pupils are taught to keep the mouth fairly
well opened, and the lips sufficiently apart to permit the free emission
of tone. Let the lower jaw have a loose hinge, so to speak. It is well
enough to
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
point out also that when the lower jaw drops, the tongue goes down with
it, and should remain extended along the floor of the mouth with the tip
against the teeth while vowel-sounds are sung.</p>

<p>There are many other ways than those already suggested, in which the
distinction between the registers may be shown. Let the whole class
sing</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music57.png" width = "133" height = "51"
alt = "high D, C, B"></p>

<p>softly, and then the next lower tone or tones loudly. The thick
quality will be heard easily enough. Or from the room select a pupil,
one of the class who has, in the phraseology of the schoolroom,
a&nbsp;good voice, to sing the scale of D ascending and descending. If
the pupil be not timid, and the kind referred to are not usually, and if
loud singing has been customary, the tone will be coarse and reedy
throughout. Now let another pupil who has what is called a light voice,
and who daily sits modestly in the shade of his boisterous brother, sing
the same scale. The tone in all likelihood
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
will be pure and flutey, at least upon the higher notes.</p>

<p>Take the scale of E now and have each pupil in the room sing it
alone. There may certainly be some who cannot sing the scale, and if the
daily singing has been harsh, the number may be large, but postponing
the consideration of these so-called monotones and directing the
attention wholly to the quality or timbre of tone used by the different
pupils, it may be observed that some use the thick voice only, some use
the thin voice, others break from the thick voice into the thin at one
pitch as they ascend, and from the thin to thick voice at a lower pitch
as they descend; and if required to sing again, may perhaps pass from
one voice to the other at different pitches. Others again may exhibit a
blending of the two voices at certain pitches. In fact, unless the
degree of power is suddenly changed, a&nbsp;break from the thick tone
upon one note to the thin tone upon the next note or vice versa seldom
occurs.</p>

<p>The same illustrative tests may be applied to children of any grade,
or of any age up to the
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
period when the voice changes, only the break will occur lower with
older pupils. Suppose, now, the teacher has obtained a tolerably clear
idea of the differences between the registers; she should then arouse a
perception of tone-quality in her pupils. Let the beauty of soft, light
tone as contrasted with loud, harsh tone be once clearly demonstrated to
a class, and the interest and best efforts of every girl or boy who has
the germ of music within them will be enlisted. Those who grumble
because they may not sing out good and loud may be disregarded, and with
a clear conscience. The future will most likely reveal such incipient
lovers of noisy music as pounders of drums and blowers of brass.</p>

<p>Select now a number of the class who upon trial have been found to
have light, clear voices and who are not prone to shout. Let them
sing</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music59a.png" width = "102" height = "55"
alt = "high E, F"></p>

<p>and then slowly descend the scale of E or F, singing each tone
softly, and those below C</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music59b.png" width = "86" height = "51"
alt = "high C"></p>

<p>very lightly. This will insure the uninterrupted
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
use of the thin register to the lowest note. Let them now sing up and
down the scale several times, observing the same caution when notes
below C or B are sung, and also insisting that no push be given to the
upper notes. Now, first excusing monotones, let the other pupils in the
room sing first down the scale and then up, imitating the quality and
softness of tone of the picked class. Recollect, you are asking
something of your pupils which it is perfectly easy for them to do. It
may be that the strength of well-formed habits stands opposed to the
change, but, on the other hand, every musical instinct latent, or partly
awakened, is becoming alert and proving the truth of your teaching
better and faster than can any finespun reasoning. Illustrate the
difference in tone-quality between the thick and thin register as often
as it is necessary, to show your pupils what you wish to avoid and how
you wish them to sing. When in doubt whether or not the thin quality is
being sung, require softer singing until you are sure. It is better to
err upon the side of soft singing than to take any chances.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<p>In time teachers will become quick to detect the change in register,
and in time also the pupils who are trained to sing in the thin voice
will yield to the force of good habit, as they once did to bad habit,
and seldom offend by too loud or too harsh tone.</p>

<p>The inquiry may naturally have arisen ere this: Are syllables, i.e.,
<i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, etc., to be used, or the vowel-sounds?
It is immaterial from the standpoint of tone-production, whether either
or both are used. Until children are thoroughly accustomed to sing
softly, they will be kept upon the thin register more easily when
singing with a vowel-sound, than when using the syllables. The reason is
that the articulation of the initial consonants of the syllables
requires considerable movement of the organs of speech, viz., the
tongue, lips, etc., and these movements are accompanied by a
continually-increasing outrush of air from the lungs, occasioning a
corresponding increase in the volume of sound. Adult voices show the
same tendency to increase the volume of tone when first applying words
to a passage practiced pianissimo
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
with a vowel-sound. It is advisable then to sing scales and drill upon
them with a vowel-sound, and to recur to the same drill for a
corrective, when a tendency to use the thick voice in singing note
exercises appears.</p>

<p>Scale drill may be carried on as follows: If the scales are written
upon a blackboard staff, they may from day to day be in different keys.
It is a very easy matter to extend the scale neither above nor below the
pitches within which it is desired to confine the voice. For example,
the scale of E or F may be written complete, that of G as follows:</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music62a.png" width = "245" height = "58"
alt = "partial scale in G"></p>

<p class = "music">
or A
<img src = "images/music62b.png" width = "245" height = "61"
alt = "partial scale in A">
or B♭
<img src = "images/music62c.png" width = "245" height = "62"
alt = "partial scale in B flat"></p>

<p>and so on. Now let the teacher with a pointer direct the singing of
the class upon the selected scale in such a manner as to secure the
desired result in tone, and incidentally a familiarity with pitch
relations, etc. Of course, if charts are used the trouble of writing
scales is saved, only it is advised that the notes lying outside the
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
prescribed compass be omitted in the lower grades entirely, and in the
upper until the habit of good tone is established, when, of course, the
tones may be carried below E with safety. The extent and variety of
vocal drill which can be given with a pointer and a scale of notes is
wonderful; but nothing more need be now suggested, than those exercises
which are peculiarly intended to secure good tone, and fix good vocal
habits, although it must be evident that all such drill is very
far-reaching in its effects.</p>

<p>A few exercises which are very simple are here suggested. First,
taking the scale of</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music63.png" width = "313" height = "62"
alt = "partial scale in F"></p>

<p>for example. Let the teacher, after the pitch of the keynote is given
to the class, place the pointer upon F, and slowly moving it from note
to note, ascend and descend the scale, the class singing a continuous
tone upon some vowel, <i>o</i> for instance. The pointer should be
passed from note to note in such a manner that the eye can easily follow
it. If the notes are indicated to the class by a series of dabs at the
chart or
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
blackboard, the pointer each time being carried away from the note
several inches, and then aimed at the next note and so on, the eye
becomes weary in trying to follow its movements, and the mental energy
of the pupils, which should be concentrated upon tone, is wasted in
watching the gyrations of the pointer. If, on the other hand, the
pointer is made to glide from note to note, passing very quickly over
intervening spaces, then the eye is not wearied in trying to follow it.
These directions may seem pretty trivial, but practical experience has
proved their importance. The vowel <i>o</i> is suggested because it has
been found easier to secure the use of the head-register with this vowel
than with <i>ah</i>, when it is sought to break up the habit of singing
loudly and coarsely.</p>

<p>The term continuous tone used to describe the style of singing
desired is meant literally. If the class in this scale-drill all stop
and take breath at the same time, making frequent breaks in the
continuity of the tone, there will be found with each new attack a
tendency to increase in volume of sound. For certain reasons,
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
which will be explained in the chapter on breath-management, the attack
of tone will become more and more explosive, demanding constant
repression. This irritating tendency may, in a short time, be almost
entirely overcome, if, instead of letting the class take breath and
attack simultaneously, each pupil is told to take breath only when he or
she is obliged to, and then at once and softly to join again with the
others. This will effect the continuous tone, useful not alone as a
corrective for the tendencies to loud singing, but also to establish
good breathing-habits.</p>

<p>This same swift, silent breath-taking and succeeding soft attack of
tone must be insisted upon in <i>all</i> school singing.</p>

<p>The exercise already suggested is slow singing or rapid singing of
the scale with the vowel <i>o</i> softly, and with continuous tones.
Other simple exercises are obtained by repetitions of the following
exercise figures at higher or lower pitches throughout an entire scale,
or parts of a scale, ascending and descending progressively:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<p class = "center smallcaps">Figure I.</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music66a.png" width = "503" height = "450"

(Again raised.) etc./ Descending./ (Same figure tone lower.)/
(Again lowered.) etc."></p>

<p class = "center">
<a href = "music/066a.mid">MIDI file</a></p>

<p>The next figure, in which the voice ascends or descends four tones at
each progressive repetition, has a different rhythm.</p>

(Still lower.) etc."></p>

<p class = "center">
<a href = "music/066b.mid">MIDI file</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<p>Another exercise figure is to use five ascending and descending
tones.</p>

<p>In the illustration which follows, in the key of B flat, it is shown
how the exercises may be sung, beginning upon the keynote, and keeping
within the voice-compass.</p>

<p class = "center smallcaps">Figure III.</p>
<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music67.png" width = "503" height = "436"
alt = "... etc./ (Same Ex. inverted.) etc."></p>

<p class = "center">
<a href = "music/067.mid">MIDI file</a></p>

<p>These exercises are to be sung with vowel-sounds, softly, four
measures with one breath, if possible, and in strict time.</p>

<p>Only so many of these tone-groups may be sung in any one scale, as
lie within the extremes of pitch set for the grade, but if different
scales
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
and upward and downward extensions of the same be used, then all
possible combinations of tones in the major scale may be sung, that is,
these exercise figures may upon a piano be repeated seven times in
<i>any</i> key, in phrases of four measures each, both ascending and
descending, but, owing to the limitations of the vocal compass, only a
certain number of ascending or descending phrases can be <i>sung</i> in
any one key.</p>

<p>While it is suggested that drill upon these musical figures or groups
of tones may be given from scales, the teacher tracing out the tones
with a pointer with a rhythmical movement, yet it is still better to
practice these groups or some of them from memory, the teacher keeping
time for and directing the class.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note</span>.&mdash;The directions given are
for rooms in which the teacher has only a pitch pipe or tuning-fork to
get pitch from. If there is a piano the drill work for tone will be
conducted a little differently.</p>

<p>Pages of musical phrases adapted to vocal drill might be given, but
to what end except to produce confusion. Our greatest singers use but
few exercises to keep their voices in good condition, but they practice
them very often.
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
The exercises suggested are intended for daily practice, and the fewer
in number and simpler in form they are, the better will be the results
in tone. This vocal drill which should precede or begin the daily music
lesson must not be for over five minutes at most. Half of that time is
enough, if it be spent in singing, and not frittered away in useless
talk, and questions and answers. A&nbsp;practical application of the
vocal drill is to be made to the note-singing from the book and chart,
and to the school repertoire of songs.</p>

<p>The phrases voice-culture, voice-training, voice-development, etc.,
have been avoided in treating the subject of children’s voices, because
of possible misapprehension of their intended meaning. The terms are
not, of course, inapplicable to children’s voices, but they must convey
quite a different significance than they do when applied to the adult
voice. In each case, the end of voice-culture is the formation of
correct vocal habits; but it would seem, that while it is possible to
develop the adult voice very considerably in power, range and
flexibility,
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
we ought, in dealing with children’s voices, to adopt those methods
which will protect weak and growing organs. The aim is not more power,
but beauty and purity rather. It should not be inferred that beauty of
tone is not equally the aim in culture of the adult voice, but in that
case it is consistent with development of strength and brilliancy of
voice, while with young children it is not. If the tone is clear,
beautiful, well poised, and under the singer’s control, then the
training is along safe lines. If the tone is bad, harsh, pinched or
throaty, then the training is along unsafe lines. When the parts act
harmoniously together, and there is a proper and normal adjustment of
all the organs concerned in the production of tone, the result is good.
Bad tone follows from the ill-adjustment of the parts concerned in voice
production. It is the office of the teacher to correct this
ill-adjustment and bring about a perfect, or nearly perfect functional
action. The teacher must judge of the proper or improper action of the
parts concerned in tone production by the sense of hearing. No
accumulation of scientific knowledge can take the
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
place of a careful and alert critical faculty in training voice. Tone
color must guide the school teacher in determining register as it does
the professional voice trainer. But we can also call the mental
perceptions of the child to our aid, and will find a more lively sense
of discrimination in tone quality than the average adult shows. We can
encourage the growth of high ideals of tone-beauty. We can cultivate
nice discrimination. We can, in short, use music in our schools not to
dull, but to quicken, the musical sensibilities of childhood.</p>

COMPASS OF THE CHILD-VOICE.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">There</span>
is the greatest diversity of opinion upon this subject among those who
have any opinion at all. It might be supposed that, among the thousands
of educators who are interested in school music and in the singing of
children generally, many might be found who have given the subject
careful attention, but such does not appear to be the case. If we
consult the musical literature published for children, the prevalence of
songs suited to the contralto voice is noticeable, indicating apparently
that the compass of infant voices at least is about the same as that of
the adult contralto. If there is any generally recognized theory upon
the subject, it would seem to be this; but from a physiological
standpoint the voices of children are totally unlike the woman
contralto, and especially is this true of children of from six to eight
years of age whose songs are usually written so low in range. An error,
started anywhere
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
or at any time, of theory or of practice, if it once become incorporated
into the literature of a subject, is liable to be frequently copied, and
enjoy a long and useless life. So with this treatment of the
child-voice. The error is in supposing that it consists of a limited
number of quite low tones. It has its origin in the sole use of the
so-called chest-voice of the child, and when the evident strain under
which a child of six or seven years labors to sing up is observed, the
conclusion seems safe that they cannot sing high. While, on the other
hand, they manage with apparent ease to sing down even as low as</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music73.png" width = "77" height = "57"
alt = "A below middle C"></p>

<p>This conception has in divers ways so imbedded itself into the
musical literature for little children, that all efforts to uproot it
have so far been apparently futile. There are, however, very many
supervisors of school music, and the number is growing, who have
recognized that this treatment of little children’s voices is a vocal
barbarity, and the device of
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
pitching songs higher than they are written to overcome the difficulty
is more common than might be supposed. There can be no doubt that in a
short time the practice of carrying the tones of little children three
and four notes below the first line of the staff will not be
tolerated.</p>

<p>The common, even universal, tendency of primary classes to drop in
pitch when singing with the usual thick tone might show anyone that the
voice was being used in an abnormal manner. Furthermore, the intonation
of children of any age is something horrible when the thick voice is
used. Even carefully-selected and trained boy choristers, if they use
this voice, are frequently off the key even when supported by men’s
voices and the organ. So in addition to other reasons for using the thin
register may be added this, that habits of faulty intonation are surely
fostered by the use of the thick voice.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself the short, thin, weak vocal bands of a child of
six or seven years attached to cartilaginous walls so devoid of rigidity
that in that dreaded disease of childhood&mdash;croup&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
they often collapse. That is not an instrument for the production of
tones in the contralto compass. No wonder the pitch is wavering. If
infant classes are to sing with the usual tones, the common advice to
make the singing-exercise short is extremely judicious. It would be
better to omit&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The intimation that the last word can now be said on this subject is
not for a moment intended, but experience has given some tolerably safe
hints in reference to the compass of the child-voice in the thin
register at the ages mentioned, and it is advised never to carry the
compass lower than E first line, nor higher than F fifth line of the
staff, and the upper extreme must be sung sparingly. The easiest tones
lie from</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music75.png" width = "110" height = "51"
alt = "F, high D"></p>

<p>The injunction to sing very softly need hardly be repeated.</p>

<p>Passing now to children who range in age from nine to eleven years,
who are found in the fourth and fifth years of school-life, it may be
observed that there is quite a marked increase in
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
the evenness and firmness of their tones. It is quite possible,
especially at the age of about eleven years, to extent the compass to G
above the staff and to D or C below; but if it does no harm, it serves
no particular good end either, and unless care is taken, the children
will push the highest tones. All of the necessary music drill can be
kept within the suggested range, and it is just as well to keep on the
safe side. Then again, the extremes in age between children of the same
class grow farther apart as we ascend in grade, and the compass must be
kept within the vocal powers of the youngest, and, from a
voice-standpoint, weakest pupils. Protect the voice, and nature will
attend to its development.</p>

<p>From the time children pass the age of twelve years on to the period
of puberty, the child-voice is at its best, and if the use of the thin
register has been faithfully adhered to in the lower grades, the
singing-tone will now be both pure and brilliant. It will be found not
at all difficult to carry the same voice as low or lower than middle C
without any perceptible change in tone-quality, and G above the staff
will be sung with
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
absolute ease. How much higher, if any, the compass may be carried is
open to discussion. It is not at all necessary in school music to go any
higher, for, even where it is deemed best to raise the pitch of the song
or exercise to avoid too low tones, the pitch of the highest note will
seldom be above G&mdash;space above.</p>

<p>Still, it is the practice of choirmasters to carry the tone of
soprano boys much higher in vowel-practice, as high even as</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music77.png" width = "77" height = "57"
alt = "highest C"></p>

<p>and although that is a pretty altitudinous pitch, there are very few
choir-boys who, when taught to breathe properly, etc., will not take it
occasionally with perfect ease. The head-register, even in woman’s
voice, is capable of great expansion, if good habits of tone-production
are followed. But again it is well to be on the safe side; and
choir-boys, who are selected because they have good vocal organs, and
who are drilled far more than school children, are hardly a criterion to
go&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the thin voice
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
can be pushed and forced. Good judgment must be exercised in controlling
the power of voice, or children will strain the vocal mechanism in
trying to outsing each other on <i>high</i> tones.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title =
"ambiguous paragraph, not indented">The question</ins>, How high may boys or girls sing who have
passed twelve years of age and whose voices show no signs of break, is
not so very important after all, for if they have been well trained in
soft tone, no danger of vocal strain need be feared even if an
occasional high A or B flat is struck.</p>

<p>The reason for the ease with which children sing the high head-tones
is found in the structure of the vocal bands. They are <i>thin</i>.
Consequently, there is, compared to the entire substance of the vocal
bands, a&nbsp;larger portion proportionately set in vibration than for
the production of the head-tone in woman’s voice. And when the
child-voice is so used that no strain of the laryngeal structure is
occasioned, that is, when the vocal ligaments are exercised in a normal
manner, it cannot but happen that the muscles controlling the vocal
bands will increase in strength, and that the bands themselves,
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
composed as they are of numberless elastic fibres, will improve in
general tone and elasticity.</p>

<p>The suggestions made in regard to the compass of voice are, be it
said, simply suggestions based on experimental teaching and are such as
it is believed may be followed with safety in school singing. If they do
not square with the music of books and charts, why, as before said, it
is a very simple matter to give a higher key for any exercise, than the
one in which it is written. A&nbsp;supervisor, by marking the exercises
in the desk copy, can ensure the use of the key he desires. If it is
objected that the tones then sung will not represent the real pitch of
the written notes, why that is at once admitted. What then? The idea of
teaching absolute pitch is a chimera. Pianos are not alike in pitch,
neither are tuning-forks. Classes will often for one cause or another
end a half tone or a tone lower than they began even if the pitch as
written is given. It may not be desirable to sing in one key music that
is read in another, but it certainly is less objectionable in every way
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
than is an unsafe use of the voice. The correct use of the voice must
transcend all considerations in vocal music, and no sort of practice
which misuses the vocal organs can be excused for a moment.</p>

POSITION, BREATHING, ATTACK, TONE FORMATION.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">One</span>
way to secure good position is to require the pupils to stand. Unless
the singing-period directly follows a recess, or the drill in physical
exercises, the pupils will welcome the opportunity. As soon as standing
becomes irksome resume the seats. No further direction in regard to
sitting position is necessary than that the body should be held not
stiffly, but easily erect and self-supporting, resting neither upon the
back of chair nor upon the desk in front. A&nbsp;doubled-up, cramped
position is, of course, all wrong, and may be avoided if the pupils are
permitted to alternate between sitting and standing positions; but, if
required to sit as suggested for too long a time, the rule will soon “be
honored more in the breach than in the observance.” This brings us to
the consideration of</p>


<h5 class = "section">Breathing,</h5>

<p>for the latter in its relations to vocalization depends
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
much upon position. The breath is the motive power of the voice in
speech or song, and the fundamental importance of managing it aright has
been understood by every teacher of voice since the time of Porpora.</p>

<p>How for singing purposes breath shall be taken, how exhaled, how
managed in short, is not yet entirely settled and presumably never will
be, for people are not born wise, and some never acquire wisdom, of whom
a few teach music. Browne and Behnke, in “Voice, Song, and Speech,”
p.&nbsp;138-142, describe the process of breathing as follows:</p>

<p>“There are three ways of carrying on the process of respiration,
namely, midriff breathing, rib-breathing, and collar-bone breathing.
These three ways are not wholly independent of one another. They overlap
or partly extend into one another. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently
distinct and it is a general and convenient practice to give to each a
separate name, according to the means by which it is chiefly called into
existence. The combined forms of midriff and of rib-breathing constitute
the right way, and
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
collar-bone breathing is totally wrong and vicious, and should not in a
state of health be made under any circumstances. When enlarging our
chests by the descent of the midriff, we inflate our lungs where they
are largest and where consequently we can get the largest amount of air
into them. When expanding our chests by raising the shoulders and
collar-bones, we inflate the lungs where they are smallest and where,
consequently, we get the smallest amount of air into them. <i>The
criterion of correct inspiration is an increase of size of the abdomen
and the lower part of the chest. Whoever draws in the abdomen and raises
the upper part of the chest breathes wrongly.</i>”</p>

<p>In normal breathing the body at inspiration increases in girth at the
waist, and the abdomen moves slightly outward as the viscera are forced
downward by the descent of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large
muscle which serves as a partition between the thorax or chest-cavity
and the abdomen. When relaxed its middle portion is extended upward into
the chest-cavity, presenting a concave surface to the abdomen.
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
At inspiration it contracts, descending so as to assume very nearly a
plane figure. At expiration the process is reversed, the diaphragm
relaxes and the abdominal viscera, released from its pressure and forced
by the abdominal muscles which contract as the diaphragm relaxes, moves
upward and inward.</p>

<p>This kind of breathing in which the muscular contraction of the
diaphragm calls in operation atmospheric pressure, supplies the body,
when tranquil, with nearly or quite enough air. When for any reason a
larger quantity of air is demanded, it may be secured by raising the
ribs, thereby increasing the chest-cavity.</p>

<p>In singing, the breath must be managed so that the air passing
through the larynx at expiration shall be set into vibration at the
vocal bands. Expiration, then, which ordinarily occurs very quickly must
be retarded by slowly relaxing the muscles which contract at
inspiration. At the same time the throat must be open, and the muscles
surrounding the resonance cavities relaxed to allow free movement of the
sound-waves set up at the vocal bands. Any
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
upward movement of the shoulders and chest at inspiration involving the
contraction of many powerful muscles of back and neck will occasion a
stiffening of the throat, which prevents free vibration of the vocal
bands and seriously interferes with the resonance of tone.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter is, that in singing we should take
breath exactly as in the ordinary quiet respiration, and avoid any
lifting of the shoulders. This is at least enough to say to a class of
children upon the subject.</p>

<p>The means adopted in education should be as simple and direct as
possible. It will be found unnecessary to say very much about breathing
in dealing with classes of children. In the first place, the moment the
subject is broached and the direction “take a good breath” or a similar
one given, each child will draw up the chest and shoulders prepared for
a mighty effort; while, if nothing is said about it, position alone
being attended to, the breathing will be all right. And again, while
adult singers for various reasons, one of which may be the supposition
that the more energy
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
put forth the better the tone, often present themselves to the
voice-teacher with a fine assortment of bad breathing-habits, children,
on the contrary, are sent to school at so young an age that a little
watchfulness on the part of the teacher only is necessary to avoid
improper ways of taking breath and establish good habits. If young
children, then, are not permitted to raise the shoulders, they will
perforce breathe properly.</p>

<p>It seems inadvisable also to give any instruction regarding the
emission of air from the lungs in singing. None but cultivated singers,
after long practice and through a complete command of the muscles
concerned, can vocalize <i>all</i> the air at the vocal bands. The
absolute purity of tone which is thus secured is a result that may or
may not be reached in any particular case. It depends upon the mental
and physical organization of the pupil as well as upon the method of the
teacher.</p>

<p>Exercises which are adapted to the formation of good breathing-habits
are much more to the point in practical teaching than efforts at
explanation.
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
Therefore, a&nbsp;few hints are given, which, it is hoped, may be of
practical value, for it is very important that good breathing-habits be
formed in school singing.</p>

<p>The change in structure which the larynx undergoes at puberty,
demolishing as it does the boy-voice, and rendering of no avail the
training of childhood in so far as it affects the larynx, does not
extend in its effects to the breathing-apparatus. So, a&nbsp;habit of
breath-management, good or bad, formed in school may continue through
adult life. Special breathing-exercises are sometimes recommended, but
their efficacy may be doubted, even if the length of time devoted to the
music lesson permits them. The inclination of pupils in such exercises
is to raise the chest and fill the lungs too full of air. The result is
too much air pressure at the vocal bands, and a stiffening of throat and
jaw muscles. The tone then will be loud; in fact, strong pressure of air
at the vocal bands is almost sure to force them into the fullest
vibration; that is, into the thick register, and, as a result of
contracted throat, the tone will be pinched, or throaty. It
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
is recognized, however, that it is just as easy to teach good habits of
breathing as bad.</p>

<p>This exercise may occasionally be given: The pupils first standing,
shoulders well set, but with no pushing out of chest, place hands at the
waist so that the movements of normal breathing may be felt. Now let the
pupils take a little breath <i>quickly</i>. The movement at the waist
must be outward and downward, never inward, at inspiration. The breath
may be held a few seconds by keeping the waist expanded&mdash;keeping an
imaginary belt filled, for instance&mdash;and then let go by relaxing at
the waist. If, however, there is any stiffening of the throat, as if it
were thought to cork up the air in the lungs, the object of the
exercise, in so far as it relates to the formation of good
breathing-habits suitable for easy vocalization, is defeated. Every
teacher must use his judgment in this matter of breath-management in
singing. If pupils are, unguided, using correct, easy methods, there is
then no need to interfere. If some are inclined to take too much breath
and lift the shoulders, a&nbsp;few hints may put them on the right
track.
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<i>Loud singing and had breathing-habits go to-*gether.</i> If the first
is desired, the lungs must work at full capacity, and hard blowing from
the lungs forces the voice. On the contrary, soft singing promotes quiet
habits of breathing; and, if the pressure of air at the larynx is
moderate, soft tone is possible. If thin, soft singing alone be allowed,
quiet deep breathing will be practiced instinctively.</p>

<p>The easy control of the muscles whose relaxation permits the
exhalation of air from the lungs is, as already said, gained by their
proper exercise in speaking and singing, for the same mechanism is
called into operation in speech as in song. In childhood the lungs can
neither hold as much, nor retain it so long and easily as in adult
life.</p>

<p>There is no better way, perhaps, to acquire the ability to regulate
the air-pressure at the vocal bands than by soft, sustained singing. The
“continuous tone” described in a preceding chapter, secured in scale
drill by letting each child breathe at will, is an excellent exercise
for developing good breathing-habits. As there is
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
no nervous tension whatever, each pupil will naturally sustain tone
until the need of another breath is felt, when it will be taken quickly
and the tone at once resumed.</p>

<p>To sum up: Sit or stand in good position, the chest neither pushed
out nor in a state of collapse. Avoid any, even the slightest, upward
movement of the shoulders. Point out the movements at waist occurring at
inspiration and at expiration if necessary, not otherwise. Let the
breath be taken quickly, not too much at a time, and as often as need
be, and sing softly.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
Attack.</h5>

<p>The beginning of each tone is called attack. The common faults of
attack in class-singing are sliding to the pitch instead of striking it
accurately, and beginning to sing with the mouth still closed, or only
partly open. When the attack presents the combined effects of these two
common habits, a&nbsp;quite realistic caterwaul is the result.</p>

<p>Both faults may be generally overcome or prevented by calling
attention to them. Good
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
mental attention is the most infallible cure for slovenly habits of
attack. It may be that there are in all schools a certain proportion of
the pupils who have very weak and imperfect vocal organs; in their
cases, even good attention cannot overcome physical inability.</p>

<p>In repose the vocal bands are separated to allow the free passage of
air to and from the lungs. At phonation the bands are drawn toward each
other, meeting just as it commences. There need be no preliminary escape
of air. Also the resonance cavities above should be open, that the
vibrations generated at the vocal bands may find expansion and
resonance. The mouth and throat should then be opened a moment before
tone is attacked, when, if the pitch to be sung is clearly pictured in
the mind, both the “slide” and “hum” will be avoided.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
Tone-Formation.</h5>

<p>Beauty of tone implies absence of disagreeable qualities, and freedom
from unpleasant sounds. Faulty tones are called nasal, guttural,
palatal, throaty, muffled, and so on, the peculiar timbre
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
of each suggesting the name. If the throat is relaxed, and if the soft
parts of the vocal tube lying between the larynx and the teeth are kept
out of the way, most of the disagreeable qualities of voice enumerated
disappear. Certain requisites are necessary to good tone-formation.</p>

<p>First, a movable lower jaw.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that so many of young and old will, when they wish
to open the mouth for song, try to keep it closed. Paradoxical as the
statement is, it nevertheless describes a very common
phenomenon&mdash;the “fixed jaw,” it may be called. As soon as the teeth
are parted slightly, the muscles of the face and neck which control the
movement of the lower jaw contract, holding it in a fixed position, and
incidentally tightening the muscles of the throat until the larynx is in
a grip as of rubber bands. The mouth must not be held open as if the
jaws were pried apart. It is opened by the relaxation of the closing
muscles and should hang by its own weight, as it were. If then the lower
jaw drops easily, and with no accompanying muscular contraction of face
or throat, the tone
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
may be formed or shaped well forward in the mouth, unless the soft parts
referred to obstruct&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>These soft parts are the tongue and the soft-palate. The soft-palate
is a structure which hangs from the posterior edge of the hard-palate.
The uvula, the pillars of the palate, and the tonsils are parts of the
structure.</p>

<p>The tongue which, when the mouth is closed, nearly fills it, should
in vocalization lie as much out of the way as is possible. If the tip be
pressed against the lower teeth and its sides upon the molars, it forms
a floor to the cavity of the mouth. If the tip turns toward the roof of
the mouth, or if it is drawn back and under, so as to arch the tongue,
tone is seriously interfered with, while if the root of the tongue is
drawn backward, the tone is shut&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>If the soft-palate is not raised in singing, the tone is diverted
into the cavities of the nose, and that color given to the tone called
nasal. If the lower jaw is held too high, the tone is again forced
through the nose. A&nbsp;nasal quality can be modified by opening the
mouth. The
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
muffled voice is sometimes the result of the tongue’s unruly behavior.
The throaty, pinched voice, due to a stiff and pinched throat, will
hardly appear if good conditions as regards position, breathing, soft
tone, open mouth, etc., are maintained. The tone should not be swallowed
nor, on the other hand, blown out of the mouth. It should be formed in
the mouth and kept vibrating within it. When the right conditions are
hit upon, the tone seems to sing itself. Whether soft or loud, the tone
should fill the mouth, so to speak.</p>

<p>It must now be remembered that beauty of tone improves along with
growth of thought and feeling. Encourage discrimination in tone-quality
and help in any way advisable the growth of good ideals, and verily
shalt thou be rewarded.</p>

VOWELS, CONSONANTS, ARTICULATION.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Sound-vibrations</span>
generated at the larynx are modified as to their form, by the size and
shape of the resonating cavities of the mouth and pharynx. Through the
movements of the soft-palate, tongue, lower jaw and lips, the shape and
size of the mouth can, within certain limits, be changed at will. As
every vowel-sound requires a peculiar form of the resonating cavity for
its production, it will be easily understood that each vowel-sound of
which the human voice is capable can be made by a proper adjustment of
the movable parts of the vocal organs. As all singing-tone is vocal or
vowel in its character, the production of the various vowel-sounds takes
precedence in the study of vocal music. Just how much of this study can
be carried on in school music will depend upon circumstances, the chief
of which is the time assigned for music. It is very easy to suggest that
if the time given is not enough, that
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
longer lesson periods be demanded; but it is quite probable that, owing
to the pressure of elaborate courses of study, the request would be
seldom granted. It remains, then, for those in charge of school music to
expedite their work by means of simple and direct methods.</p>

<p>Each division of the music work must be carried so as to secure unity
of result. The vocal drill, oral or written, will train the eye and ear
for sight-singing, and the sight-singing be a practical application of
correct vocal drill.</p>

<p>The study and practice of the different vowel-sounds must then <i>fit
in</i> with the scheme of study. The practice of singing the vowels by
name as, <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, is not to be
recommended, as only one, namely <i>e</i>, stands for a single
sound-element; nor is it probable that the results will justify
extensive drill upon the more obscure vowel-elements, if the term may be
applied to those sounds which are differentiated only slightly from the
more pronounced vowel-sounds.</p>

<p>There are some twenty vowel-sounds that are used in English speech,
but for various reasons
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
a less number are employed in song. For, while it is desirable to give
to each word and syllable its correct vowel-sound in singing, those
which are unfavorable to good tone are usually approximated to the sound
of those more favorable to good tone.</p>

<p>If too marked distinctions in the vowel-sounds are made by the
singer, the result is disagreeable; while if the voice preserves a
similar hue or tone-color throughout, the effect is pleasing.</p>

<p>The listener is unaware of the slight deviations from the spoken
vowel-sound which the singer makes, that the requirements of tonal
beauty may be met.</p>

<p>It is advisable in vowel-practice to avoid letters or symbols which
represent two sounds, an initial and a vanish; and to use simple vowel
elements instead. The combinations of different elements represented by
certain letters and diphthongs may easily be explained when they appear
in the words of a song, if, indeed, the study of phonics has not already
cleared away all difficulties.</p>

<p>In singing, however, it is necessary to understand
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
which of the two sounds, the initial or the vanish, is to be sustained.
In <i>ā</i>, for instance, which is <i>eh</i>+<i>e</i>, if the vanish
<i>e</i> is sustained in a word like <i>day</i> the effect is
<i>deh-ee</i>. The first sound should be sustained, and the vanish
<i>e</i> be heard only slightly as the mouth partly closes at the end of
the tone. <ins class = "correction" title =
"not italicized in original"><i>Ī</i>,</ins> again, which is equivalent to
<i>ah</i>+<i>e</i>, is often sung by prolonging the <i>e</i> instead of
the initial <i>ah</i>, as
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘lah-eet’?"><i>light&mdash;li-eet</i></ins>.
<i>Ō</i> is a compound sound <i>ō</i>+<i>ōō</i>, but the tendency to
sing the first sound short and prolong the second is very slight
usually. <i>O</i>, then, can be used to represent a simple element.
<i>Ū</i>, which equals <i>e</i>+<i>oo</i>, is best sung by making the
initial sound short and the vanish the longer tone.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that of the five vowel names, <i>a</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>e</i> only stands for one
sound, though the two sounds of <i>o</i> are so closely allied that the
vanish is often imperceptible. The sound of ā in ăt is the most
unfavorable sound for song in the language, and those extremely
consistent singers who wish to use it can do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>The nasal twang of Yankeedom is a plant that
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
needs no nourishing. Its roots are grown wide and deep; so much so, that
those who love it need not fear that it will pine away and die, if it
bears no fruit of song, but only that of speech.</p>

<p>The sound of <i>ă</i> will survive even if it is unused in song. It
should in singing be broadened nearly to the sound of <i>ah</i>.</p>

<p>A number of simple elements are suggested which may be used in
various ways in vocal drill. They are <i>ē</i>, <i>ĭ</i>, <i>ĕ</i>,
<i>ä</i>, <i>a̤</i>, <i>õ</i>, <i>o͡o</i>. Or <i>ē</i> (as in
<i>be</i>), <i>ĭ</i> (as in <i>it</i>), <i>eh</i>, <i>ah</i>, <i>aw</i>,
<i>ō</i> (as in <i>go</i>), <i>o͡o</i>. The vowel-elements remaining are
each so closely allied to some of those indicated that the attempt to
differentiate them from the above in vowel-drill is hardly worth while.
In fact, the use of <i>ĭ</i>&mdash;<i>i</i> as in <i>it</i>&mdash;may be
omitted if pupils have learned to sing <i>ē</i> with fair breadth of
sound, and <i>oo</i> may be dropped in grades above the primary. It is
the final sound of <i>ō</i>, as before said. This leaves five
vowel-elements.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
E.</h5>

<p>This vowel is often badly sung, and its form is none too favorable to
good tone even when made as large as distinctness will allow. The
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
lips must be drawn a little away from the teeth as in a smile, <i>but
don’t overdo it</i>, and the teeth slightly parted. The lips should not
be drawn back, exposing the teeth and gums, nor should they be
contracted and pressed against the teeth. In <i>e</i> and in all vowel
singing the lips should be relaxed, not contracted, and kept about as
far from the teeth as they are in repose. If the opening of the mouth,
that is, if the cavity back of the teeth is kept too small and narrow,
the tone will be nasal and twangy. The mouth must be opened enough to
permit purity of tone and free emission. The sound should verge toward
<i>i</i> in <i>it</i>.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
I.</h5>

<p>This sound is <i>ē</i> broadened. The teeth may be a little farther
apart than when <i>ē</i> is sung.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
Ĕ or EH.</h5>

<p>This is the sound of <i>e</i> in the word <i>get</i>. It is also the
initial sound of the vowel <i>ā</i> or long <i>a</i>. It is true that
this sound is not usually so given, but if <i>ā</i> is sung with this
sound as its initial sound, and the one to be prolonged, the very best
vocal results can be obtained. The vowel
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<i>ă</i> is more often poorly sung than otherwise. This is, perhaps, for
the reason that comparatively few singers recognize that long <i>a</i>
stands for two sounds, and that the first, which may be spelled
<i>eh</i>, can be sung with large form and placed well forward in the
mouth, while the second sound <i>ē</i> is small in form, and not adapted
to the finest tone-effects. In singing this element, the jaw should drop
much lower than for <i>ĭ</i> and nearly as low as for <i>ah</i>.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
Ä or AH.</h5>

<p>This is the tone universally accepted as the best for
voice-development; but in school-singing it is not permissible to use
the voice except in the lightest manner, therefore purity of tone must
content our ambitions; power can come later in life. The mouth opens
widely for this tone and the whole throat is expanded.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
A̤ or AW.</h5>

<p>This element is formed very much like <i>ah</i>. It is <i>ah</i>
broadened a little. The jaw drops to a lower point and the mouth-cavity
deepens, while at the same time the extension from side to side narrows
a little.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<h5 class = "section">
Ō and OO.</h5>

<p>These sounds are better adapted to securing the use of the thin
voice, where pupils have been accustomed to the use of the thick voice,
than any other vowel-element. The mouth is well opened back of the lips,
which should not be puckered as if to whistle, but relaxed instead.</p>

<p>In actual practice there may be observed a tendency, more or less
marked, but pretty sure to manifest itself if practice on one sound is
continued too long at a time, to deviate from any one toward some other
vowel-element, as <i>ĭ</i> to <i>ē</i>, <i>eh</i> to <i>ĭ</i>, <i>ah</i>
to <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: one ‘er’ may be an error for ‘eh’"><i>er</i> or <i>er</i></ins> or <i>uh</i>, <i>aw</i> to
<i>uh</i>, <i>ō</i> to <i>oo</i>.</p>

<p>If this tendency to deviate from the right tone be permitted, the
most slovenly habits will be formed, and all distinctions in vowel-sound
disappear. Vowel-practice had better be omitted from class-work unless
carefully and conscientiously taught.</p>

<p>If the course of music embraces drill upon scales, vowel-practice may
be incorporated into the course easily. For instance, the drill outlined
upon p. 70 may one day be given with <i>e</i> for a few moments, then
with <i>o</i>. On another
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
day the drill may be upon <i>ah</i>, followed by <i>eh</i>, and so on.
It is unnecessary to particularize. Every teacher will at once see how
to apply practically vowel-singing to his music course. The exercises
and songs may be sung with vowel-sounds. Nearly all books advise the use
of <i>la</i>, <i>lo</i>, etc., in vocal exercises; but while that method
of singing is unobjectionable, the vocalization of <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">solfeggii</ins>, it may be
observed, is established by the sanction of time and the experience of
thousands of voice-trainers the world over.</p>

<p>The advantages which flow from vocalizing exercises and songs on a
single vowel-sound are too many to be described in a word. No supervisor
or teacher of music can afford to use <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>,
exclusively.</p>

<p>Another class of exercises is now suggested which may be sung upon
one breath. They will be found especially adapted to develop flexibility
and a ready adjustment of the movable parts of the vocal tube to the
positions suited to the formation of the different vowel-sounds. If
three sounds are used as here given, they must be sung quite slowly, the
change from one sound
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
to the next being made by a quick, easy change of position of the jaw,
tongue, etc., but without interrupting the continuity of the tone.</p>

<p>Sufficient pause to obtain a new breath must be made at the end of
each group, and the mouth opened properly for the production of the
first sound of the next group before it is attacked. The time should
be</p>

<p class = "music">
<img src = "images/music104.png" width = "230" height = "62"
alt = "letters ‘o, e, o’ sung on F"></p>

<p>quite slow and as in illustration, or the breath will not be used,
and at each succeeding group of tones the lungs will become too full of
air. The attack will then be explosive, and the tone too loud, if,
indeed, the effort to control the breath does not contract and pinch the
throat.</p>

<p>Eight groups are given for ascending a scale and eight for
descending:</p>

<table summary = "vowel sounds">
<tr>
<td>ō</td><td>ē</td><td>ō</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>ō</td><td>ē</td><td>ĭ</td>

<td>ō</td><td>eh</td><td>ē</td>
</tr>
</table>

<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<p>It will be observed that a certain system of arrangement of the
vowel-elements is followed. First, there are five groups, of which
<i>o</i> is the first and last sound, the others being placed between.
Then <i>o</i> is the first tone with <i>e</i> as the second, the other
sounds in turn ending the group. Next <i>ah</i> is the second sound,
then <i>eh</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>oo</i> and <i>ah</i> might be used as the
second vowel-element, making thirty-five combinations with <i>o</i> as
the initial sound of each group. The same number of combinations can be
made with <i>ah</i> as the first tone, and so on with each of the seven
vowel-elements.</p>

<p>Sixteen of these groups, changed from time to time as may be desired,
can be written upon the blackboard and sung by the class in the way set
forth, the teacher meanwhile keeping time for and directing the
class.</p>

<p>It may be observed in this connection, that, as the voice ascends in
pitch, there is a tendency to blend the various vowel-sounds into one
sound. As the tones grow higher the sound-waves are focused at higher
points upon the hard-palate, the sounding-board of the resonance
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
cavities, and more difficulty is experienced in moulding these
sound-waves into the forms characteristic of the different
vowel-elements. As the parts concerned in tone-formation gain in
flexibility, the result appears in the ease with which the alterations
in shape of the resonance tube are made at higher pitches.</p>

<p>Fads and devices which divert attention from the subject and retard
rather than accelerate the progress of pupils are common enough in
schools, but the following simple illustrations of different vowel-forms
may be found useful:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic106.png" width = "375" height = "182"
alt = "mouth shapes for ‘ē ĭ eh’ and ‘ah aw o oo’"></p>

<p>The base line represents the floor or base of the mouth-cavity, and
the arch, the height and width of the mouth for each sound; the depth is
not indicated. The width of the mouth from
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
side to side is represented as greatest in <i>ē</i>, <i>ĭ</i> and
<i>eh</i>, while the height is greater in <i>ah</i> and <i>aw</i>,
<i>o</i> is pictured as nearly round, and <i>oo</i> the same, only
small.</p>

<p>It is not contended that these diagrams picture the actual form
assumed by the resonance cavities very accurately. The various positions
which the tongue and the soft-palate assume are not shown at all, nor,
perhaps, is it necessary; for if the pupil is taught to drop the lower
jaw to the right position for each sound, and to keep the tongue prone
in the mouth, a&nbsp;mental picture of each tone will be formed, and the
thought will regulate the action. When the pupil can think the sound
desired, the conditions for its formation will be met by the vocal
organs. The usefulness of diagrams will then cease.</p>


<h5 class = "section">
Consonants and Articulation.</h5>

<p>“Consonants are the bones of speech. By means of consonants we
articulate our words; that is, we give them joints. We utter vowels, we
articulate consonants. If we utter a single vowel-sound and interrupt it
by a consonant, we
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
get an articulation. Consonants, then, not only give speech its
articulation or joints, but they help words to stand and have form, just
as a skeleton keeps the animal from falling into a shapeless mass of
flesh; therefore, consonants are the bones of speech. The consonant is
the distinguishing element of human speech. Man has been defined in
various ways according to various attributes, functions and habits. He
might well be called the consonant-using animal. He alone of all animals
uses consonants. It is the consonant which makes the chief difference
between the cries of beasts and the speech of man.”&mdash;<i>Richard
Grant White</i>.</p>

<p>Consonants are not to be sung. The effort so common among singers to
pronounce, by sustaining consonant sounds, is entirely misdirected.
<i>M</i>, <i>n</i> and <i>ng</i>, which are made by shutting off the
escape of the air-current at either the lips or the hard-palate, and so
forcing it through the nose, are often sustained to the detriment of
beauty of tone and clear pronunciation as well.</p>

<p>Articulation, which is the pronunciation of a consonantal sound, is
accomplished by interrupting
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
the air-current, whether vibratory or not, at certain points. The
interruptions are made by the meeting of the lips with each other or
with the teeth, by the tongue with the teeth or hard-palate, and the
root of the tongue with the soft-palate. The interruption may be
complete, as in <i>p</i> or <i>t</i>, or only partial, as in <i>th</i>.
The sound of the consonant results from the slight explosion or puff
which follows the recoil of the movable parts from the point of
contact.</p>

<p>All consonants may for singing purposes be considered as preceding or
following some vowel-sound. If preceding, then after the sound is made
the vocal organs must be adjusted at once for the proper formation of
the succeeding vowel. If the consonant sound follows a vowel-tone, the
movement of the vocal organs to the interrupting point must be quick and
vocalization at once cease; for if the vowel-sound is prolonged after
the production of the consonant, the effect will be an added syllable to
the word as <i>at-at-er</i>, <i>up-up-pah</i>, etc. The movements of the
organs of speech for both contact and recoil must be
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
more rapid in singing to produce distinct articulation than in spoken
language.</p>

<p>Slovenly habits of articulation in speech will reappear in song, and
the converse is also true. The study and practice of phonics, which is
now general in schools, is of the highest practical importance in
singing, as well as in reading or speaking. As consonant sounds cannot
be sung, they are best taught in spoken language. The application of the
knowledge and skill thus gained is readily applied to the pronunciation
of words in singing. If the vowel-elements have been carefully practiced
in vocalizes, there will be little effort required to secure the correct
formation of all the vowel-sounds of words.</p>

<p>The nasal twang must, however, be ruthlessly suppressed. As before
suggested, this will frequently appear in words containing the sound of
<i>a</i> as in <i>at, past, fast</i>, etc. It is recommended that such
words be sung with <i>a</i> as in <i>father</i>, or if not quite as
broadly, at least approaching the sound of <i>ah</i>.</p>

<p>If the movements of the vocal organs are quick, flexible and without
muscular tension or stiffness,
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
and if the mouth opens neither too much nor too little for each
vowel-sound, words may be sung and understood while beauty of tone is
not sacrificed.</p>

MUTATION OF THE VOICE.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
anatomical and physiological changes which occur in the larynx at
puberty have been described in the chapter on “Physiology of the Voice.”
It may be added that at this period the resonance cavities also undergo
considerable alteration in size and form.</p>

<p>As childhood is left behind the individual emerges. Divergences in
face, in form and in mental characteristics become emphasized. The
traits of race and family are manifested and self-consciousness becomes
more acute. This period of development, bringing as it does so much
disturbance to the vocal organs, is particularly inimical to singing;
and yet public school music is expected to produce its most elaborate
results in those grades where the pupils are just about to enter, or are
passing through this period of rapid growth and change. The singing in
such grades may be discussed with reference first to the singing of
girls and then to that of boys.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<p>The vocal organs of girls often develop so gradually in size, and
with so little congestion of the laryngeal substance, that no aversion
is manifested to singing. In other cases the inflamed condition of the
vocal organs is shown by the hoarseness which follows their use, and the
huskiness of the singing-tone. The voices of nearly all during the
mutation period show more volume of tone on the lower tones and
evidences of strain at the higher tones.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to put girls who show throat-weakness,
characteristic of their age, upon that part which requires only a medium
range of tones, and to repress all inclination to force and push the
voice. The desire which girls often express to sing the upper soprano
need not affect the teacher to any great extent. A&nbsp;multitude of
strong and constantly-shifting ambitions are thronging through their
minds. Some wish to sing the highest part because it seems to them to be
the most prominent part; some wish to sing it because they can do so
with the least mental effort, and so on. These whims and wishes must be
treated tactfully, but if the teacher
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
is sure that a certain course is right, there is no alternative but to
carry it out, with as little friction as may be. Large voices, that is,
voices that proceed from large resonance cavities, are often badly
strained at this period of life by too loud and too high singing. It
must not for a moment be forgotten that the age is a critical one for
vocal effort, and a strain that the adult woman’s voice will endure with
apparent impunity may produce lasting evil effects on the voice of a
girl of from fourteen to sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>If the requirements of the music are such that pitches above F, the
fifth line G clef, must be occasionally sung, let the voices upon the
part sing lightly. If some of the girls are put upon the lower of three
parts, do not let them use the chest-voice, which is just beginning to
develop, otherwise than lightly also.</p>

<p>The boy’s voice may change from the soprano to a light bass of eight
or twelve tones in compass in a few months, or the change may extend
over two or three years; that is, two or three years may elapse after
the first distinct break before
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
there is any certainty of vocal action in the newly-acquired compass.
When the voice changes rapidly, all singing should be stopped. Really,
in such cases, boys cannot sing even if they attempt to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>They are so hoarse, and the pitch alternates so unexpectedly between
an “unearthly treble and a preternatural bass” that a boy can usually
sing only in monotone, if, with courage proof against the ridicule
occasioned by his uncontrollable vocal antics, he <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘trys’">tries</ins> to join in. In
those cases, where the larynx undergoes a slow change in growth, it is
often possible for the boy to sing all through the period of change. The
upper tones may be lost, while there is a corresponding gain of lower
tones. This process, in many cases, goes on slowly and with so little
active congestion of the larynx that the voice changes from soprano to
alto, and thence to tenor almost imperceptibly. Voices which change in
this way often become tenor, but not invariably.</p>

<p>The question now arises, Should those boys who can sing while the
voice is breaking be required to take part in school singing
exercises?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<p>In Browne and Behnke’s work, “The Child Voice,” to which allusion has
been made, there is given a resumé of 152 replies to the question: Have
you ever known of boys being made to sing through the period of puberty,
and, if so, with what result?</p>

<p>The answers were:</p>

<p>Forty correspondents have no knowledge.</p>

<p>Five think the voice is improved by the experiment.</p>

<p>Ten quote <i>solitary instances</i> where no harm has arisen.</p>

<p>Ten know of the experiment having been made, and consider it has
caused no harm to the voice.</p>

<p>Eight mention results so variable as to admit of no conclusion.</p>

<p>Seventy-nine say the experiment causes <i>certain injury</i>,
deterioration or ruin to the after voice, and of this number ten observe
that they have suffered disastrous effects <i>in their own
person</i>.</p>

<p>These answers were from English choirmasters, organists, music
teachers, singers, etc.
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
It will be noticed that only fifteen of those who give a positive
opinion upon the subject think that boys can sing through the period of
break safely; while seventy-nine are positive that the result is unsafe.
The other replies are vague.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that many of the opinions are those of
instructors in cathedral schools, where one or two rehearsals and a
daily church service means a great deal of singing; while other answers
come from choirmasters who require of their boys equally hard work,
though less in quantity.</p>

<p>Every individual voice must be judged by itself, if such demands as
choir-singing are made upon it; and, while there are some cases, as
every choirmaster will probably agree, where no perceptible injury
results from singing during the change, the rule is that even when
possible, it is very unsafe.</p>

<p>But the daily time given to singing in schools is very short; the
work bears no comparison with choir-singing. It might almost be thought
as necessary to forbid reading and talking during
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
the break of voice as to forbid its use in a daily drill of fifteen or
twenty minutes in singing.</p>

<p>Certainly it is absurd to advocate entire non-use of the voice at
this period in either speech or song. It is rather correct to guard
against its misuse. If boys have up to this time used only the thick
register, they will in singing through the break intensify their bad
habits; throatiness, harshness, nasality will become chronic. This would
be bad enough, but each bad vocal habit results from the abnormal use of
the vocal organs, and occasions hoarseness, chronic sore throat,
catarrh, etc.</p>

<p>It is quite customary in school music to assign the boys to the lower
part, in part music. This practice continued from the time part-singing
begins in the music course, compels the boys to use the thick register.
As the larynx gains in firmness from year to year, they experience more
and more difficulty with their upper tones&mdash;those lying from F
to&nbsp;C. Having used only the thick voice in all their school singing,
they know of no other, and very likely consider the thin voice which
they are now obliged to use in singing
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
the higher tones as altogether too girlish for the prospective heirs of
manly bass tones.</p>

<p>The reluctance of boys to sing the soprano would be amusing were it
not, in the light of utterly false training, so pitiful.</p>

<p>School music is educational; its scope is controlled by those in
charge. The public expects good educational, rather than show work, and
employs those to supervise and teach who are supposed to know what good
educational work is in vocal music.</p>

<p>The supposition that children’s voices can, owing to individual
differences analogous to those existing among adults, be divided into
alto and soprano voices, is erroneous; children can most assuredly sing
in parts, but the quality of tone which in the woman’s voice is called
alto or contralto cannot be secured for certain physical reasons
previously explained; and the use of the chest-tone, which resembles the
adult woman’s chest-voice as a clarinet resembles a viola, is wholly
objectionable.</p>

<p>If, however, the voices have been trained in the use of the thin
register only, the management
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
of the boy’s voice during the change is simplified; the influence of
good vocal habits will be felt; the vocal bands which have never been
strained will respond when their condition admits of tone-production.
The boy who has been accustomed to sing with an easy action of the vocal
ligaments and with open throat will at once become conscious of any
unusual strain or wrong adjustment in the vocal organs. If he has
learned to sing well, he has also learned not to sing badly.</p>

<p>The test to apply to the subject of boys’ singing in school during
the break may be: Can they sing without strain or push? Can they sing
easily, or does it hurt? There is a certain amount of humbug in boys
that must be allowed for, but it does not affect calculations as to
their singing-powers more than upon their other abilities, if singing is
well taught.</p>

<p>The speaking-voice also indicates the state of the vocal organs, and
shows the effect of the break sooner than does the singing-voice. If the
tones in speech are steady in pitch, singing is possible in all
probability. If, on the contrary,
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
the speaking-voice is croaky and wavering, singing is difficult, if not
impossible. As the object of the study of vocal music in the public
schools, in so far as it relates to the treatment of the voice, is to
develop good vocal habits, not bad ones, it follows that if boys sing
during the break it must be only upon those tones which lie within their
compass at any time, and that the vocal organs must be used lightly, and
without strain.</p>

<p>In nearly every upper grade room there will be a percentage of boys
whose voices are in a transition stage, some of whom can sing and others
of whom cannot. It requires judgment and tact to handle these voices,
but if boys have sung as they should up to this period, and have taken
pleasure in it, the mutual good understanding between them and their
teacher need not be disturbed. They are likely to do their best.</p>

<p>In this connection it should be said, that really it may be doubted
if the common practice of assigning all boys, whose voices show signs of
breaking, to the bass part, is right.</p>

<p>If boys have been kept upon the lower part, in
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
all part singing and have never used other than the thick chest voice,
then, when the voice begins to break up, it may be that they must sing
bass or not sing at all. Boys trained in this way have never used the
soprano head register and so if they sing alto, it will be with the
thick chest voice of boyhood, which will now be the upper tones of the
developing man’s voice.</p>

<p>Singing alto at the mutation period in <i>this</i> manner, strains
the vocal bands beyond reason, and should not under any circumstances be
allowed. It must be understood then in what follows, that singing alto
in this, the chest voice, either before or during the break, is
unqualifiedly condemned.</p>

<p>But we will suppose now that boys have been permitted to sing only in
the head register, that they have been assigned to the upper part in
part singing, for notwithstanding that usage is to the contrary, this is
what should be done. As has already been suggested the voices of girls
change less, and at a younger age than do boys, and they begin to show
weight of tone and increased volume, at an age when boys are at their
best as
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
sopranos. Girls at this period should sing the middle and lower parts,
but it must be said in passing that much of the music contained in our
text-books ranges too low in pitch for them, or any voice except a low
contralto or a tenor. They must not be permitted to use their voices at
full strength, and special care should be taken of those who at this age
show hoarseness. With girls as with boys, the change is accompanied with
periods of great relaxation of the vocal bands, and during these periods
the singing tone is either very light, or very loud.</p>

<p>Returning to the subject of treatment of boys’ voices during
mutation, and premising that they have sung only in the head voice
during childhood, the question arises whether they are not in many cases
set to singing bass prematurely. It is obvious that during this period
the voice is actually <i>broken</i>, divided in two. The lower notes are
produced in the chest or man’s register, while more or less of the boy’s
voice remains as upper tones. These tones, by the way, never are lost,
they remain as the falsetto or head voice of the man.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<p>Now the vibratory action of the vocal ligaments is much larger for
the chest voice than for the head, or as we ordinarily call it, the
falsetto. There is then no question that during mutation a boy can
confine himself to the use of his old voice, or so much of it as is
available at any time with very little strain. The tone will be light,
in fact, during the active periods of laryngeal growth which
characterize mutation, there will perhaps be no voice at all, owing to
the congestion of the parts, but in the periods of rest separating the
periods of growth, the vocal bands will respond. The compass of the head
voice at this time varies largely, but it corresponds pretty closely to
that of the second soprano, in three part exercises, or from C
to&nbsp;C. If it is attempted to carry the voice down it changes to the
chest register unless used very lightly.</p>

<p>Without attempting then to lay down positive rules for treating a
voice which consists of fragments of voices, the above suggestions are
made in the hope that they may receive the consideration of teachers and
musicians.</p>

THE ALTO VOICE IN MALE CHOIRS.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">The</span>
suggestions of the preceding chapters are addressed directly to those
who teach vocal music in public or private schools, but the general
principles and rules are equally applicable to the training of soprano
choir boys.</p>

<p>The results in beauty and power of tone which may be obtained from
carefully selected choir boys can seldom be equalled in the school-room,
first, because training is required to develop voices in strength and
purity of tone, and the time devoted generally to school singing, one
hour a week possibly, is no more than that given to a single rehearsal
of choristers.</p>

<p>Again school singing includes all members of the class, and while it
is true that there may be but few pupils in each room who cannot sing,
yet there are likely to be some.</p>

<p>These voices, which we call monotones disappear
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
almost entirely when pupils are trained to use the head voice. Still,
there is a percentage in every class in school, whose inherited musical
perceptions are very feeble, and their slowness cannot but retard the
general progress.</p>

<p>Many of the difficulties that beset the teacher of music in schools,
then, are eliminated at the start by the choir trainer, when he selects
boys with good voices, who sing in tune naturally.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of vested choirs in this country has been
very rapid during the past few years, and fortunately, the ideas which
have prevailed among the majority of choir-masters on the subject of the
boy voice, have been just. This is easily understood when we reflect
that we have made the best English standards our ideal.</p>

<p>The leaven of sound doctrine on the boy voice is working rapidly, and
there are many choirs both in our large and small cities that are
excellent examples of well-trained soprano boys.</p>

<p>There is, however, one problem of male choir training which is not
yet satisfactorily solved, at least it is troublesome to those choirs
which have a small or moderate appropriation for music.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<p>Boy sopranos are plentiful, basses and tenors are easily obtained,
but good male altos, men, not boys, are almost unknown outside of a few
large cities. This state of affair has led, in many cases, to the
employment of boys as altos, and they have of course sung with the thick
or chest voice. It is an unmanageable and unmusical voice, it is harsh,
unsympathetic, hard to keep in tune, its presence in a choir is a
constant menace to the soprano tone, and were it not for the idea that
there is no recourse from this voice, save in the employment of woman
altos, it would not be tolerated by musicians.</p>

<p>There is a recourse, however, and it is at the command of every choir
trainer whose sopranos have been taught to sing with the head voice
alone. It is to select certain sopranos, and when the voice breaks, let
them pass to the alto part, and <i>continue to use the head
voice</i>.</p>

<p>The objection which will naturally occur, is, that no singing should
be permitted during the break. Well, let us consider. The period during
which the voice, in common parlance, is breaking, is a period of
laryngeal growth, just as
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
inevitable and natural, as is the growth of the body generally. The
voice may be fractured, but the larynx is not.</p>

<p>Every choir trainer must have observed the preliminaries to this
period. A&nbsp;boy for instance, shows all at once a sudden increase of
volume and finds it difficult to sing unless quite loudly or softly.</p>

<p>This shows that the vocal bands are relaxed. Following this, the
speaking voice will lower in pitch, and show hoarseness at times. As
soon though, as this hoarseness passes away, that is, when the
congestion at the larynx has passed, the voice is better perhaps than
before. Then comes another break, as we say, that is, a&nbsp;period of
sore throat and hoarseness.</p>

<p>After this has passed, it may be that the boy has lost his upper
notes, but can sing the lower ones with ease; the tone too, is changed
in timbre. It has the color of the man’s head voice; or it may be that
the boy can still sing his high notes, but that the lower ones are
uncertain. Voice mutation is not one continuous period of growth of
vocal bands and laryngeal cartilages. On the contrary, the periods of
vocal disturbance
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
are separated by intervals when the throat is comparatively free from
irritation. These intervals may be long or short. It evidently depends
upon the rapidity or slowness of the general growth and development.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt now, that during a time when the voice is
uncertain and hoarse from the irritation of the vocal bands and
surrounding parts, that singing is positively harmful, but during the
intervals separating these periods, especially where they extend, as in
many cases, over several months, it would seem that the singing voice
might be used.</p>

<p>Each individual case must be observed and judged by itself. This is
entirely possible in choirs. If then the choir-master is careful to
observe and to humor the changing voice at all critical times; if he
will insist that the boy sing very lightly or not at all if it hurts
him, and if he will resolutely check any tendency to break into the
tenor or chest quality, he can train in a short time a good alto force
from his choir, and these young men so trained may become efficient male
alto singers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<p>It is true that in many cases boys may be carried through the
mutation period, and at the end show such light tone upon the falsetto
or head voice as to be of no value. The strength and timbre of the male
falsetto depends partly upon the character of the vocal bands and partly
of course upon the size and shape of the resonance cavities.</p>

<p>Men who have voices of wide range and good volume in the chest or
usual singing voice, generally possess strong head or falsetto tones,
and it may be that soprano boys who possess large voices, that is those
which show volume of tone along with purity, whose resonance cavities
are large, will prove to develop a better falsetto, as men, than those
boys whose voices are thinner. One other point remains to be disposed
of. Will the use of this voice by youth or adult, injure his other
voice, be it naturally bass, baritone, or tenor? No, it will not, and
yet the average choir-master will most assuredly be met with this
objection or fear. It is surprising that so many of those who are in the
business of trying to teach voice, should be ignorant of the character
and
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
range of the male falsetto or head voice, but in spite of this
ignorance, and more or less prejudice against its use, the fear that by
using it one impairs the tones of the chest register or the usual
singing voice, is utterly unfounded. It is produced with far less effort
and tension of the vocal bands than is the chest voice, and is
physiologically perfectly safe. The mechanism which the larynx employs
to produce the falsetto is just as natural as the mechanism employed to
produce the chest voice. That it is an unusual voice with us is due to
circumstances of musical development. The advent of the male vested
choir has, however, created a demand for it, and it may be met as
indicated, by keeping boys upon the head voice during mutation or so
much of the time as is safe, and afterward, when the age of adolescence
is past, even if some prefer to sing bass or tenor, the number of those
available for the alto parts will be sufficient to meet all
requirements.</p>

<h5 class = "subhead">
GENERAL REMARKS.</h5>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">In</span>
the preceding chapters, dealing as they do with special subjects or
subdivisions of the main topic, the effort has been to point out and to
suggest some ways in which good vocal habits may be taught, and simple
and effective vocal training carried on with whatever materials there
may be at hand in the shape of books, charts, blackboards, staves, etc.
The leading idea is the correct use of the voice; the particular song or
exercise which maybe sung is of no special importance; the way in which
it is sung is everything.</p>

<p>The benefits of teaching music <i>reading</i> in the schools are a
matter of daily comment. Is it, then, likely that the good resulting
from the formation of correct habits in the use of the voice will fail
of recognition? Not so. For the effect of good vocal training in school
music would be
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
so general and so beneficent that even unfriendly critics might be
silenced.</p>

<p>The first effect upon singing when the thick tone is forbidden and
the attempt made to substitute the use of the voice in the thin or head
register may be disappointing. It will seem to take away all life and
vigor from the singing. Teachers who enjoy <i>hearty</i> singing will
get nervous; they will doubt the value of the innovation. In those
grades where children range in age from twelve to fourteen years, the
apparent loss in vocal power will disconcert the pupils even. Never
mind; the <i>use</i> of the thin register will demonstrate its
excellences, and it will, if slowly yet surely, increase in brilliance
and telling quality of tone.</p>

<p>Again, the compass downward needs to be more restricted at first than
after the children have become habituated to its use. As long as there
is any marked tendency to break into the chest-voice at certain pitches,
the compass should be kept above them; as the tendency weakens, the
voice may with due caution be carried to the lower tones, in higher
grades be it understood.
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
The tone should grow softer as the voice descends when the lower notes
will sound mellow and sweet. At first they may be quite breathy, but as
the vocal bands become accustomed to the new action, the breathiness
will disappear. One thing at a time is enough to attempt in music, and
while a change in the use of the voice is being sought, it may happen
that sacrifices must be made in other directions; part-singing, until
the voices become equalized, that is, of a similar tone-quality
throughout the entire compass, may, as it requires the singing of tones
so low as to occasion easy recurrence to the thick voice, be so
antagonistic to the desired end that it must be dropped for a time.
After the use of the thin voice has become firmly established,
part-singing may be resumed. How low in pitch the lower part may with
safety be carried depends partly upon the age of the pupils; but until
the chest-voice begins to develop at puberty, all part-singing must be
sung very lightly as to the lower part or voice.</p>

<p>There is a class of pupils always to be found in our schools who
cannot sing in tune; they
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
vary in the degree of their inability from those who can sing only in
monotone, to those who can sing in tune when singing with those whose
sense of pitch is good, but alone, cannot. While the number of entire or
partial monotone voices decreases under daily drill and instruction, yet
there always remains a troublesome few, insensible to distinctions in
pitch; it is, in view of the possible improvement they may make,
a&nbsp;difficult matter to deal with them; for if they are forbidden to
sing, the chance to improve is denied them, and if they sing and
constantly drag down the pitch, why the intonation of those who would
otherwise sing true is injuriously affected.</p>

<p>Many who sing monotone when the thick voice is used, do so because
the throat is weak and cannot easily sustain the muscular strain; if
they are trained to the use of the light, thin tone, they can sing in
tune. After children have been under daily music drill for two or three
years in school, if they still sing monotone, it would seem inadvisable
to let them participate with the class in singing. They do themselves no
good, and they certainly injure the singing of
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
the others; for, as before suggested, constant falling from pitch will
in time dull the musical perceptions of those most gifted by nature.</p>

<p>During the early years of school-life the pupils may often sing out
of tune because the vocal bands and controlling muscles are very
weak.</p>

<p>It is an excellent idea to separate the pupils into two classes:
First, those who can sing with reasonably good intonation; and second,
those who can sing only a few tones, or only one.</p>

<p>Let the second class frequently listen while the others sing. They
will thus be taught to note both tone and pitch, and if any musical
sense is dormant, this should arouse it; but, if after long and patient
effort a pupil cannot sing, let him remain silent during the singing
period.</p>

<p>Every possible effort should certainly be put forth to teach children
to sing in tune, but yet it is now, and will doubtless remain true, that
a small per cent. cannot be so taught.</p>

<p>The primary causes of monotone singing may be physical or mental; in
many cases, weak vocal organs and feeble nervous power, in others lack
of pitch-perception&mdash;tonal blindness.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<p>The secondary causes include the influences of environment and
heredity. The contempt in which music has been held by a portion of the
English-speaking people from the time of the Reformation until quite
recently, or shall we say until even now, has made its powerful impress
upon opinions, tastes, and natural powers. Singing, with a part of our
population, is literally a lost art, lost through generations of
disuse.</p>

<p>It is often urged by educators that each study must help other
studies. The various subjects which are taught must move along, as it
were, like the parts in a musical composition, dependent upon,
sustaining, and harmonious with each other. Now, while it is not within
the scope of this work to discuss the relation of music to other studies
in all of its bearings, it is yet clearly in line with its general tenor
to suggest that the tone in singing will react upon the speaking-voice,
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Now, if pupils recite and speak with a noisy, rough tone, it will not
be easy to secure sweet, pure tone from them when they sing; but, on the
other hand, while they may be specially

trained in good singing-tone, it will not, as a result, follow that the
speaking-voice will be similarly modified. Special attention must be
given to this also; but if children invariably sing with pure tone, it
must be very easy to direct them into good vocal habits in speaking and
reading.</p>

<p>It is no more necessary for children to recite in that horrible,
rasping tone sometimes heard, than it is to sing with harsh tone; and if
the same principles are applied to the speaking-voice as are herein
given for the management of the singing-voice, in so far as they may be
applicable, this harshness and coarseness may be avoided. It is the
pushed, forced tone in speech or song that is disagreeable.</p>

<p>If teachers will consign to well-merited oblivion those two phrases,
“speak up” and “sing out,” and will, instead, secure purity and easy
production of tone, with <i>distinctness of articulation</i>, they will
do wisely. Let us not hesitate to teach our pupils to know and to feel
that which is beautiful, and good, and true, that our schools may
promote the growth of good taste, and stand for the highest morality and
the best culture.</p>
